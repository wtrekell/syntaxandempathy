You are correct that the `ai-trials` files function as monthly digests, often detailing multiple experiments or facets of the research conducted within that month [1]. The timeline I previously provided summarized the main theme or overall focus of each file.

Drawing upon the sources again, we can construct a more granular timeline that highlights the distinct tests and activities documented within these monthly files. Here is a breakdown of the trials associated with the files starting with "ai-trials," detailing what was tested and the corresponding file name:

This more detailed timeline outlines the specific experiments and focus areas within each monthly AI trials file, reflecting the iterative nature of the research across the year [2, 20, 21].
