# Process
1. Worked with Claude to create the original templates.
2. Used Claude and GPT to further refine.
3. Piloted the refined templates for the first time with Claude 4 Sonnet and Claude 4 Opus.
3.1 Pilot was the first article on brainstorming with AI, ==add title once complete==
3.2 Despite instruction mentioning the review of materials before starting, Claude 4 Sonnet whipped up an article without any materials on the topic.
3.3 I had the AI write the article with only the raw materials, curious to see the output before providing the template.

From the first attempt using the long form template
2. Intrestingly enough, sonnet had less sections, possibly half as many, when they did the comparison.
2.1 Neither preferred their own to the templates. Sonnet rankng itself last, opus in second place.
2.2 After going back and checking, both prefered their versions from the Claude template.
2.3 I had each outline the 3 best and worst aspects of both, and the reason was clear...something about the claude template failed to restrict them from embelishment.
2.3.1 Going back and reviewing the templates the issue becomes pretty clear incredibly quick, Claude specified what should be marked, the AI filled in the rest without second thought. This means that not only did the template fail, but the safe guards I have in place to prevent the AI from writing on my behalf failed as well.

4. I took the two problematic articles back to the session they were created in. It was fairly slanderous, citing several items that were a result of the AI writing on my behalf, the actual reason for the failure of the template.
5. Curious, I went back to see if sharing the GPT versions helped it to realize the issue. They were ranked lower because they adhered to the original instructions.
6. With all 4 articles, Opus failed to connect the dots, that the instruction I had been most explicit about failed to happen.
6.1 After pointing out that the items it was citing were because the AI wrote in my place, it nailed them across the board.
6.2 I poked around to see if Claude wouldmake a useful recommendation for a fix, once my usage had essentially run out I had to tell it to fix the templates after a number of recommendations that would have been significantly more work for me.
6.3 I have new templates, I can't imagine I have more than one prompt left for the night, the warning came up 2-3 ago. 
6.4 I went back and skimmed through the 2 articles from Claude's template. The one by Sonnet was a far greater offender than the one by Opus. The latter had wrote in filler content as well, but it had at least annotated the same areas...in some it looked like it was trying to provide an example of what to right (which still defeates the purpose of me having to strip shit out), while others it appeared to indicate additions...amusingly enough, theyw ere the sections I said it could all but leave blank for me to write.
6.5 Looking back at the prompt o3 wrote for the task, and I'm sure it contributed to the issue, but it was the instruction followed for all articles so the Opus version still had a weak spot.
6.6 It's getting late, I'm getting tired, and I need to keep cleaning off this laptop so I can ship it back to offset the price of the new one. With these things in mind, I'm going to choose the dumbest option available. I'm going to throw the new template at the vesion of Opus that already wrote the 3. I don't want to spend the time tofix the original prompt, and I'm done with this for the night anyway. Let's invite the shitshow in.
6.7 Well, that was a success. It wrote something that exists between the experiment and the topis of the favored article. 
6.8 At this point, I think I'm at the same amount of time spent doing almost the same process. This time, I don't have anything from Claude that is usable base don it's own template. I read the ones from GPT later, maybe I an use them as a better starting point.

# Next Day
7. Somewhere in the middle of the night I worked with Opus on the template. We'll see how it goes.
7.1 I had Opus take shot at writing, it wasn't horrible but still represented a lot of work to clean up.
7.2.1 I took a second try with a clean slate, but this time I didn't supply my notes. I had to poke it a few times but got what I was looking for (not a final, mind you)
7.2.2 I handed it my notes and told it to flag all additions with XML, I think I'm close enough to take it to edits now.

# Addl Material
1. Gather information form the 2024 experiments along these lines as supplemental material.
2. Be sure to review the session logs for each session, it appears you used 2 different starting points. Probably the agent wars confusion.
