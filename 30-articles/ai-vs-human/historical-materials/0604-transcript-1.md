Okay, this is after the new direction. Phase two looks the same. This is the information I'm expecting. The expectation is that I supply the draft and the first revision, and you supply this information.

You supply this information. I expect you to review each draft, each version between versions to track information for ethical transparency.

I have noticed that art collects to hold onto things. I don't know if it's the fact you can have multiple tabs visible at once, or the fact you're gonna have multiple tabs of tabs. I don't even know how to put that. I will not be making any changes to the application's code for this request as you're asking me to perform the analysis and provide what? I'm providing the content. I'm asking you to measure it.

Initial, tell you that this effectively breezes my first revision. Text details about your revision processing. Did you use any—once I had this information, you need to help you, and then it just says, no. The line of thinking doesn't even clearly lead to anything.

I'm not writing the best prompts right now either, as you've heard. Refining it is talking about text comparison, text analyzer, improved analysis, smart field population. That's not promising. Okay, I understand you. Oh, there it goes. I'm not gonna read all that.

This is a lot more code than the Python. That was really close. Let's do it in React though. Maybe that's the approach. I did ask it to give me something I could execute elsewhere. I did that with the other things, but the approach was different. I haven't given this anything to start with. The others, I had written some JSON and then it switched to Python from there. And I kept providing it with the Python. So that might have been initial text, draft, previous version. Okay. Markup languages. I just did that. Articles, I've gotta file this better. Okay, there it is.

Oh, that's not great. Did I not—okay. Draft edited, final, refined. Okay. Where's the four version? Ooh, that was not what I expected to happen. Okay. Draft.

It's not great that I have to paste this, but it actually works. Refined is next. These revised here, count of generated ideas, outlines incorporated. I'm just gonna give it three—log of research tasks. One, I should keep this someplace, human-provided prompt two. Plexity deep research three. What's your finger now between the case Gemini deep research and—no, I don't talk to myself this much, it's because I'm reading out loud. Oh, wait, what? Okay, this—oh God, I just got an error without doing anything but typing into the text box. The text area to be specific.

This is very peculiar. The type never usually indicates a situation. The typescript believes it should not happen, like a variable in an unreachable code block or a function that never returns. Sure.

It goes on for several paragraphs there. So yeah. Three—one prompt by human, two—research by AI. I just closed those. I just want to get past, give me content. I just want to get past, give me content. Draft. I will not close these this time.

That's interesting. It left the text and the text yields AI-generated work. So it's just shuffling things.

How did I get here? I copied a bunch of content about what should be measured out of notebook, based on who knows how many resources at this point. Proportion of sections written by a verse human. I don't even think it could get to semantic meaning change with what it's asking for.

So I'm just going to—but it doesn't even—nope. Initial text. Oh, what? Okay, I hit analyze and it populated, easier to confirm if this is—well, where do I confirm it? Yes.

Next, I can just next through this. Text comparison summary, initial text. I never would've guessed this is how this worked. So apparently just clicking next is fine. I see what it's doing.

I wish I—well, there's the ability to go back. I'm not going to do that. This is what the messy exploration looks like. So I can click, I don't have to put anything in. I can just keep clicking next. That doesn't seem to have required fields.

It's not changing the labels on the two text areas, but I bet—I don't know, I'll have to do this differently. It is asking me for the different pieces of information, the over-the-top, nobody-does-this guidance or outline—it's not even guidance, the guidance is simplistic at best and only suggests it. Okay, whatever.

The article was generalized. It didn't incorporate my real-world experiences, so I updated to do so. Phase one, human-driven research tools were employed during the initial research. Research by AI. Human judgment was paramount. AI-assisted article drafting, initial draft. User to confirm this was the—yeah, AI-assisted article updates. AI tools were utilized during the updates. 0% estimated. So yeah, I never changed them because I didn't know what was going on. He and Arthur actively shaped AI's output into final work. Demonstrated initial text, revised text, approximate words, approximate words removed. I don't know that that means more than I moved a big section. I don't think I did, but nobody else would know the difference. Article was generalized. Now it's putting my own comment in. Curating options of all this. Highlight skills in prompt craft and AI curation.

Not really. I serve as an amplifying human. It really gave me the benefit of the doubt. This disclosure, improved. Copy to clipboard. I think it took me two or three days to get the JS this far.

I could get this to do it. It just needs—I don't think it's using a data store. Maybe it is. I don't think it is. I think it's carrying it in memory. I didn't change the articles per step because it wasn't clear that's what I needed. Oh, AI draft/previous. Sure. Thanks. Nobody reads, you're the only one that reads and then you convert it to tokens. You don't know what anyone's saying. Okay. So I think I need to provide it with stricter definitions of what it needs to do—not necessarily the desired output, but I think it needs a hint at the mathematics it needs to do well. Explicitly cast text, compare a text, compare b to string before passing them to diff words and if sentences, this would be redundant given their types.

Reporting on the counts, yes. But somewhere in there, I think the understanding of the semantic change lives. I can't think that through right now. Confirm final human review and accountability. Well, I can copy it already, so I don't mean January report. It's just, yeah, that's what I saw already.

It doesn't even require the checkbox. Oh, well, let's see what happens. It doesn't require the checkbox. It gives me the report now. Same thing. Checkbox is pointless.

Okay. I don't think I've even spent an hour and a half on this, maybe an hour.

And that's what you get for trying to do programming through chat UI. Kids, try harder than I did. I did not really use sophisticated prompts with any of that. I just kept feeding it its own content and telling it what I wanted, not in a vibe or whatever kind of way, whatever that means.

And I'm sure that's, well, it sounds like it's right next to just at a roll. Okay. We're done. I'm done. I didn't get what I wanted, but this was impressive just the same.

I've really gotta look at this interface. Hide code. I thought I was going to be like, oh, click me and I'll come in and save the day. But no, that's not what that is.
