I am legit satisfied. It's 11 o'clock, it's done. There's trend analysis in there, but I don't have enough data backed up to actually check that, so that will have to wait. We did a test and the test ran, but I don't have the data to render visualizations for that. I don't think it built them in, which is fine. That would probably be the next step.

We got that done and moved on to the visualizations. It kicked out an error there once or twice. I don't think I even wrote that down. Basically, we had maybe an error per major step or phase. It put together the entire graphics package: flow charts, pie charts, heat map. I can't process it all at the moment, so I don't know the numbers. The percentages look right, but I don't know if these are the charts I want. I'll worry about that later.

There are style changes I definitely want to make, but I don't even need to use this tool for that. It's all in matplotlib, which is what almost everything uses, so that's not a problem. There's a modification intensity chart showing low similarity, medium similarity. It has the same number for both—I don't know if that's correct, so I'll need to keep an eye on that.

Honestly, I'm amazed. I've probably spent no more than three hours. As things progressed, I got sloppier with time and just in awe—started working on something else in another browser window while it was coding.

There's cleanup that needs to be done: some formatting of the visualizations, colors, things like that. I can do that myself. It works. It even threw in a Sankey diagram in HTML, so it's interactive. It did all that. It's wild. I struggled so many times to get this working before. Is it perfect? Probably not. That's something a lot of different documents have pointed out: doing this is intense work for the person. That's the caveat I mentioned early on—I'm not going to tag every sentence, so we're skipping that level of detail.

I need to save this—don't forget to save it. I guess I'd have everything in the session, but I really need to take a break.

I'll come back and handle cleanup in a bit. I think this visualized trend analysis is in there. It even adds them in parentheses when you have more articles, so I can comment these and put them in the cells. I have everything there in case it doesn't do it automatically, but I imagine it probably does.

So that's a thing now, for real.
