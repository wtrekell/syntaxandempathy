  Note: It never removed the sample data despite me mentioning it wasn't needed. This is something I've noticed when doing this sort of thing with Gemini as well, it just keeps going forward...you have to tell it to clean up after itself.

  Note:
  Yes, exactly. CELL 1 in this new artifact (Steps 3-4) is the first cell you run after completing Steps 1-2 from the previous artifact.

So the full sequence is:
- **Previous artifact**: Cells 1-5 (Steps 1-2: Data ingestion and preprocessing)
- **New artifact**: Cells 1-5 (Steps 3-4: Similarity analysis and attribution mapping)

You already have `article_versions` and `preprocessor` loaded from Steps 1-2, so now you run the new CELL 1 which installs the additional dependencies needed for similarity analysis.

It's interesting that it keeps giving me the command to execute as a python command and not putting it in the notebook, I wonder if it's going to lace it all together?

Another aside, when asking a question about something like this you HAVE to tell it to just answer, not rewrite, the "eagerness" they build in is likely the culprit here.

time to second error 15m, it kept running so we'll see what happens

code was updated but it was suggested I proceed, we'll see if it prompts me to modify later

note: times include actual analysis. first phase wasn't long, second is taking it's sweet time. I'l have to run through again to document runtime (I'm not going to do that,this is already overkill)
- Just passed 6m runtime, started mapping attributes
- Oh crap, I looked away at 8 minutes to do something in another window, we're going with:

time to second error, 20m

I need to check times stamps in the session log if it has them (I'm not going to that, GPT might though)

5m to swap out code, ~6m to attribution. It included the difflib fix in the process.

time to error 3, 8m (includes the 6 stated above)

Holy shit, it had me run a diagnostic rather than random updates for the next hour, like Gemini has done (ad admittedly Claude 3.5)

It didn't occur to me before, but Gemini always nickel and dimes me with udpates being isolated to a portion of the code, Claude is updating the entire thing each time. There is a happy middle where just giving me the updated cell would be ideal, but I'm not going to tempt fate here.

I think I'm maybe 2 hours in. Phase 2 is good. I just recorded thoughts.

We're moving into trend analysis now, and it's just dawned on me that this has, very much, been a collaborative experience. This is the fuel of a thought/credibility piece.

Start of phase 3, first signs of degredation.
- I provided the date format I use for folders to make identifying them easier. It identified the right wildcard location on the first go, but then kept dropping it all the way to:

time to fourth error, I don't even know, I'm we're this far.

Ok, It was wrong about the format, but I messed up the folder name as well, I guess we're even.

Into the visualization portion at this point, finally got hit with the session length and needing to confirm that it continue.
