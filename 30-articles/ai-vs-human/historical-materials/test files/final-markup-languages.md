# Mermaid AI Test Run

*Testing the capabilities of AI-assisted diagram creation*

## **TL;DR:**

My Mermaid AI test became a study of human-AI collaboration. The tool **generates initial diagram structures faster than manual methods** but **struggles with modifications and consistency**. This experience demonstrated where Mermaid AI adds value versus creates friction, though my unstructured approach limited definitive conclusions.

## Why Mermaid?

I first encountered Mermaid script through ChatGPT-3.5 when requesting diagrams. It's become my go-to diagramming approach for over a year now because of its practical flexibility.

Diagramming tools involve tradeoffs. Mermaid script enables rapid iterations despite limited aesthetics, while Figma delivers polished results but becomes unwieldy during early stages when changes happen frequently.

I wanted to see if Mermaid AI could maintain script-based flexibility while accelerating creation. My goal was simply to assess the tool's capabilities, not to create a specific diagram.

## Starting Without a Clear Map

I typically sketch diagrams before using any tool, but I jumped straight into testing without planning. This created frustrating cycles of restructuring an increasingly complex diagram. The experience reminded me that effective diagramming depends on knowing what you intend to represent, something I had forgotten amid the flexibility of script-based approaches.

Based on my experience, I recommend these approaches for using Mermaid AI across different diagramming needs:

### For Exploration Mode (Figuring It Out As You Go)

- Start with a simple outline using a basic concept description
- Build incrementally rather than tackling the entire structure at once
- Connect completed sections to minimize potential issues
- Use the AI to iterate on small, manageable sections

### For Direction Mode (You Have a Clear Concept)

- Provide Mermaid AI with a detailed outline of your diagram
- Let the AI generate the initial structure, then fine-tune specific elements
- Fine tune connections and hierarchy once the structure is in place
- Treat the AI as an accelerator rather than expecting a perfect final product

### Documentation Mode (You Know What You Need)

If you prefer using AI over learning script language or using applications like Figma:

- Document the diagram in text, then use that as a script for the AI
- Provide precise instructions about connections and relationships
- This approach minimizes surprises and maximizes control
- Use AI primarily as a translation tool rather than a creative partner

I started with "Direction Mode" when "Exploration Mode" would have better suited my needs. This created friction during revisions where an incremental approach would have worked far better.

# Collaborate with AI Diagramming Tools

## The Speed-Control Tradeoff

AI-assisted diagramming generates initial structures 2-3x faster than manual methods, giving you a significant head start. However, this advantage fades during revisions, ultimately resulting in lost time. The tool handles additions well but becomes unreliable during modifications. Changing one element often breaks established connections or introduces inconsistencies.

This technology builds excellent scaffolding but struggles to maintain context during iterations. Be sure to consider this when planning your workflow.

## Behind the Interface

The generated code revealed issues beyond the visual interface. My template theme variables and class definitions were stripped out, while the syntax became unnecessarily verbose, requiring manual cleanup.

I discovered that explicitly instructing the tool to maintain existing connections improved results. Effective collaboration requires learning specific prompting techniques through practice.

## A Mental Model for Collaboration

Think of AI tools as technical collaborators rather than independent creators. They excel at initial drafts but need clear direction during revisions.

Align your approach with the fidelity of your thinking about the outcome. Guide the process actively when exploring concepts. Provide structured inputs when documenting established systems.

## Tips From My Experience

Through many iterations, my diagram evolved from a complex tangle to a streamlined visualization. Here are key insights for working with Mermaid AI:

### Design Principles

- Match your approach to the fidelity of your thinking
- Use brief node names for easier adjustments
- Create visual hierarchy with subgraphs to group related activities
- Explicitly instruct the AI to preserve existing relationships when making changes

### Workflow Practices

- Use '**Change All**' functionality in edit mode for consistent updates
- Document your creation process for future modifications
- Be transparent about AI assistance when sharing with teams
- Plan for manual refinement after AI-generated drafts

These practices align with what makes any complex system model effective: concise terminology, clear categorization, focus on key relationships, and consistent patterns.

## Integration with Documentation

Mermaid delivers the most value when integrated into your documentation ecosystem. Its text-based approach works across numerous applications including Notion, Obsidian, and many other platforms. This enables version control alongside other documentation, creating a single source of truth that evolves with your systems.

This integration transforms diagrams from static artifacts into living documentation. Maintaining diagrams as code provides long-term benefits that outweigh the initial learning curve, especially for complex systems needing frequent updates.

## The Final Verdict

The AI-assisted approach proved worthwhile despite requiring time to learn. Creating the diagram manually would have taken at least twice as long.

For complex diagramming tasks, Mermaid AI offers **a powerful starting point but not a complete solution**. I found the best results come from using AI to rapidly generate the initial structure while I maintain control over refinement and styling.

Understanding both your own clarity level and your tools is essential when choosing your approach. I've discovered that the process of creating the diagram often delivers as much value as the final visualization itself.
