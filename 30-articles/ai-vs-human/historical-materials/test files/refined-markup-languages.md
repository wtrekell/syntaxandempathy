# Mermaid AI: A Tool Trial for Diagramming

*Testing the capabilities of AI-assisted diagram creation*

**TL;DR:** When I decided to try Mermaid AI for diagramming my content creation workflow, I was simply curious to see if it would be beneficial. What began as a straightforward test evolved into a fascinating exploration of representation, abstraction, and human-AI collaboration. The trial revealed that AI excels at generating initial structures 4-5x faster than manual methods, but struggles with modifications and style preferences. The journey from a verbose, complex diagram to a streamlined visualization reinforced my existing approach to diagramming and highlighted both the promise and limitations of AI assistance.

## Why Try Another Tool?

Interestingly, my first exposure to Mermaid script came through ChatGPT (version 3 or 3.5) when I asked it to create a diagram for me. Since then, I've been using the script version for over a year specifically because of its flexibility and practicality.

There's always a tradeoff in diagramming tools. Mermaid script gives me quick modification capabilities, even if the output isn't presentation-deck quality. Something like Figma produces visually polished results but becomes impractical for early iterations where changes are constant.

My curiosity about Mermaid AI was straightforward: would it combine the flexibility of script with faster creation? I didn't need a diagram—I wanted to test the tool.

## Starting Without a Clear Map

Typically, I sketch a diagram before diving into any tool, ensuring I have a clear direction. This time, I hadn't really considered the process in any detail. This mismatch between my approach and reality led to a cascade of revisions as my understanding evolved. What should have been an exploratory, iterative process became a frustrating cycle of restructuring an increasingly complex diagram. The experience reinforced something I already knew—your diagramming approach needs to match your level of clarity about what you're visualizing.

Looking back, I see how different approaches would serve different diagramming scenarios:

### For Exploration Mode (Figuring It Out As You Go)
- Be a writer. Start with a simple outline, then flesh it out as you review and reconsider.
- Grow the diagram from the ground up, expecting multiple revisions as your understanding evolves.
- Use Mermaid AI to generate small sections that you gradually connect, rather than trying to create the entire structure at once.

### For Direction Mode (Having a Solid Idea)
- Provide the AI with a clear framework and let it fill in details as you go.
- Expect to make a manual pass through the code afterward to clean up and standardize.
- The AI serves as an accelerator rather than a complete solution.

### For Documentation Mode (Knowing Exactly What You Need)
- Write out the diagram in text first—what it is, what it connects to—then use that as a script for the AI.
- This approach minimizes surprises and gives you the greatest control over the output.

I came in trying to make things up as I went (Exploration Mode) but approached the tool as if I had a solid idea (Direction Mode). The problems intensified when I started making substantial changes to sections I'd already created—exactly the situation where a more iterative, writer-like approach would have served me better.

## The Initial Speed Advantage

Where Mermaid AI truly delivered was in generating the initial structure. What would have taken me an hour or more of manual setup materialized in minutes. The AI generated a robust first draft approximately four to five times faster than I could have done it manually—a significant time savings by any measure.

This rapid scaffolding demonstrated the tool's primary advantage. Having something tangible to react to accelerated the process, even if that something wasn't perfect.

## Modification Issues Drive Code Inspection

The real challenges emerged when I started making changes to the diagram. While the AI handled additive instructions well ("add this node," "connect these elements"), it became unreliable during revisions. If I asked it to move something or connect a different element, it would often undo all previous connections.

I learned that you can explicitly tell it to maintain existing connections, but you have to know to do so—highlighting how working effectively with AI tools often requires discovering their quirks through trial and error.

These modification issues eventually drove me to examine the code itself, where I discovered another drawback: the AI had stripped out much of my template formatting and produced what was probably the most verbose version possible of the Mermaid syntax. For someone who prefers tidy code, this was a significant issue.

I also made a critical error that compounded these challenges: using long node names. With every modification, I had to repeatedly type out these verbose identifiers. Had I known how much tweaking would be involved, I would have used brief node names from the start.

## Pro Tips From My Experience

Through dozens of iterations, my diagram gradually evolved from a complex tangle to a streamlined visualization. This transformation reflected my growing understanding of how to work effectively with Mermaid AI.

The key improvements and lessons included:

1. **Apply different approaches based on clarity:**
   - If exploring a new concept, start small and build incrementally
   - If you have a clear framework, provide that structure and let the AI fill in details
   - If you know exactly what you need, write it out in text first as a script for the AI

2. **Use brief node names:** Makes adjustments and updates with the AI much easier.

3. **Create clearer visual hierarchy:** Using subgraphs to logically group related activities.

4. **Tell the AI to maintain connections:** Be explicit about wanting to keep existing connections when making modifications.

5. **Use 'Change All' in the editor:** For consistent updates across a complex diagram. This is a lifesaver.

6. **Expect code intervention:** The AI creates a solid foundation, but refinement requires manual adjustment.

What's interesting is that these improvements mirror the evolution you'd want in your mental model of any complex system: concise terminology, clear categorization, focus on key relationships, and consistent patterns.

## The Final Verdict

There's definitely a learning curve to working with Mermaid AI. I already have ideas for GPT scripts that will address many of the frustrations I encountered.

But despite the friction points, the AI-assisted approach delivered significant value. If I had tried to create the diagram manually, it probably would have taken me twice as long. The initial time savings alone justified the experimentation.

For complex diagramming tasks, Mermaid AI offers a powerful starting point—not a complete solution. The human-AI collaboration works best when we leverage the AI for rapid structure generation while maintaining control over refinement and style.

The key is knowing yourself as well as your tools. Be honest about your level of clarity, choose your approach accordingly, and remember that the process of creating the diagram might be just as valuable as the diagram itself.
