I don't even know how many versions of this I have at this point. And when I say versions, I mean attempts.

1. App.py, ah, this the one I abandoned when Codespaces informed me I wwas doing prod environment things. So that's bad.
2. Gemini's Typescript brick that stole several hours of my life.

**5/13** This is a continuation of of a thread I appear to have deleted.
- Part of the history is gone, just an error alter now.
- I recall the file/data set it's referencing, my guess is there were 2 scripts, one to get me the data, and one to get the visualizations. For a couple of versions I had to split it apart to isolate issues with both the script and the AI trying to run it.
- Given the inputs I'm providing it early on I have to assume this was being done across two sessions, possibly two AI, and the other was clearly crapping out since these are obiously AI responses.
- There were a few exchanges up to a point where it started having issues and I can only imagine I walked away.
- I was able to feed it data from earlier on and it managed to produce freesh results. No telling if they're any good.
- I had it provide an overview of the entire conversation:
Below is a concise, step-by-step timeline of our conversation and the work we’ve done together:
**1. Initial JSON Spec for AI Chatbot**
* You shared a detailed JSON schema outlining how to compute human-contribution metrics (100 − retention%) and generate four charts plus messaging templates, focused on emphasizing human editorial impact.
**2. First Script Execution**
* I loaded your uploaded `base_agg.csv`, calculated alteration percentages, and produced the four charts (horizontal bar, grouped bar, Sankey, and metric display) inline.
**3. Request for Updated Framework**
* You pointed out that “low retention” undercounts brand-new content additions, and provided an enhanced JSON spec introducing new-content estimates, alluvial diagrams, stacked bars, and before/after comparisons to capture creative expansion.
**4. Clarification on Retention vs. New Content**
* We discussed the difference between “100 − retention%” (alteration of the draft) and true “new content” share, highlighting scenarios when draft and final lengths differ.
**5. Simplified Chart Request**
* You provided a streamlined instruction JSON for four visualizations (horizontal bar, grouped bar, waterfall chart, and large-number summary) with a blue-to-green gradient.
**6. Rendering Attempt & Environment Issue**
* I attempted to render the charts in-chat but encountered an environment reset that lost access to your CSV.
**7. Code Snippet for Local Execution**
* I provided a standalone Python snippet you could run locally to regenerate all four charts, along with instructions on file placement.
**8. Data Paste & Final Rendering**
* You pasted the five data rows directly; I reconstructed the DataFrame in-memory, recalculated alterations, and successfully rendered all four visuals inline.
**9. High-Fidelity Downloads**
* You asked for high-resolution outputs; I re-generated each figure at 300 dpi, saved PNGs to `/mnt/data`, and provided download links for all four charts.

This timeline captures each major milestone in our collaboration—from JSON specifications and conceptual refinements to code execution, chart rendering, and final deliverables. Let me know if you’d like to add anything else for your records!

**5/10** Noise
I found a thread where, I had apparently had enough. There's a fair bit of sailor in the transcripts I provided the AI.

This wasn't a test, like the others, this was clearly the result of frustration if not actual anger. It has transcripts of my tribulations, 5 versions of a python script that I'm guessing never worked. And, undoubtedly, it represents several days of work with nothing useful to show for it. I bet it's a good read when it isn't getting late and I have to think about how I'm prone to think in my sleep...

Obs, didn't give up, however if I don't find anything else in another AI it looks like I put that shit aside for nearly a month. This is the last of what is still in GPT and, oddly, it is fresher than most of what follows, not sure why.

"""
** 6/6/25** Attempted to use Claude 4 Opus. While the prompt wasn't incredibly sophisticated it wasn't bad either. First, it tried to give me a webpage that served as a tracking app so I could log my F'ing time. I responded:
> I could manage that with paper, no wonder you went with a web page. I want to give the 4 articles to something (I assumed python) that would measure things like counts, changes, shifts in semantics. Actual transparency

I got python, which I've run in ChatGPT o4-mini-high, provided it with the test files, and we've achieved data/visual.

Needless to say, the output looked nothing like the example Claude stated I could expect.

```text
Content retention: 67.3%
Word count change: +18.5%
Vocabulary expansion: 1,247 → 1,432 unique words
Estimated AI contribution: ~32.7% of content transformed
```

I'd put the JSON in, but it's about 100 lines of single words.

GPT was sure that I wrote the article draft, and thne AI contributed 96% of the final...that's def what happened.

All conversations captured.

UPDATE:
I found a thread with the articles, script, and results. It was a single run so I got to a point where I thought it was good enough. We'll see if I find more of the story. Either way, I have all I need to test all of the ones that run against each other!

Or not, I appear to have nuked the files.

UPDATE: 6/9
The name of the initial script looks the same, so I assume this is an ongoing attempt to get this one farther than before.
- Can verify by comparing the differetn versions of python
- This might be the first time measuring semantics came into play. Even if I'm wrong (and it doesn't read like I am) this is.
- AI made recommendations on my requests to follow the meaning, not the counts. 
- One of the methods it had offered... Ah crap, I remember this now.
-- It employes an OpenAI model for working with language. It couldn't run it and I asked about codespaces and collab. I guess this isn't where I learned about those. I'll have to assume my memory of it being SERP is still accurate.
- There were conflicts with different packages it tried calling from different locations, it recomemended swithcing the function whih is where it stops. I think I have the original that it stepped back from working in the curret version. I'll have to check that.
Over the course of our conversation, we’ve worked through analyzing how your document evolved from draft to final:

1. **Initial Analysis Script**
   You shared an AI-Writing Process Analyzer that computed basic metrics (character/word counts, average sentence length), text-based similarity (via `difflib`), and vocabulary shifts between each stage.

2. **Stage & Transition Metrics**
   We ran that script on your four versions—Draft, Refined, Edited, Final—and saw:

   * A big expansion in the Refined draft (≈69% more words, \~300 new terms).
   * A heavy prune in the Edited version (≈34% fewer words, \~126 new terms).
   * A final polish in the Final version (≈5% trim, \~72 new terms).

3. **Topic Modeling Attempt**
   I demonstrated an LDA topic model (4 topics) and plotted how topic proportions shifted—but we noted it was hard to interpret, since each document strongly favored one topic.

4. **TF-IDF Semantic Similarity**
   We switched to TF-IDF + cosine similarity for clarity, producing easy-to-read percentages:

   * Draft → Refined: 81.2%
   * Refined → Edited: 67.8%
   * Edited → Final: 89.4%

5. **Draft → Final Comparison**
   You asked for the overall Draft→Final score, which came out to 61.2%.

6. **Updated Analyzer Script**
   I provided an enhanced Python script (in our canvas) that merges the new Draft→Final semantic similarity into your existing metrics output.

7. **Sentence-BERT Discussion**
   I explained SBERT (a Siamese BERT for producing quality sentence embeddings), how it compares to LDA and TF-IDF, and outlined how you’d integrate it locally or in cloud notebooks.

8. **Cloud Setup Guidance**
   Because SBERT isn’t installable in our sandbox, I walked you through:

   * Running SBERT in GitHub Codespaces via a devcontainer.
   * Running SBERT in Google Colab, including installing and using `sentence-transformers`.
   * Troubleshooting version conflicts (pinning `transformers`, `huggingface-hub`, and `sentence-transformers`).

At this point you have:

* A clear, topic-free similarity metric for all transitions including draft→final.
* An updated analyzer script that outputs everything in one place.
* Instructions for running SBERT-based analysis in Codespaces or Colab (with dependency-pinning guidance).

### Getting it functional

1. **Create and activate a virtual environment** (recommended):

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Install the required Python packages**:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn
   ```

3. **Run the script**:

   ```bash
   python /mnt/data/ai-writing-analyzer-enhanced.py
   ```

The script will print out your **Stage Metrics** and **Transition Analysis** (including the direct Draft → Final semantic similarity) to the console. Feel free to modify the file paths at the top of the script if you store your Markdown files elsewhere.
