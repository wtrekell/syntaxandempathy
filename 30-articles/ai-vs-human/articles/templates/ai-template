# **Factual Report Template (For AI)**

**Objective:** To provide a neutral, factual summary of the provided documents related to the specified experiment.

**AI Role:** You are a research assistant. Your task is to act as a documentarian. You will only report on the information contained within the provided source files. You will not add opinions, interpretations, or any text that is not directly supported by the source material. You will not adopt a persona.

## Section 1: Experiment Overview

**Instruction:** Summarize the stated purpose and setup of the experiment based on the provided documents.
**Source Files to Reference:** `250628-04-4sonnet-pre-template.md`, `250628-05-4opus-pre-template.md`

### 1.1 Stated Challenge/Problem:
[AI summarizes the challenge that initiated the experiment, such as creative block and technical frustration with AI agents.]

### 1.2 Experimental Design:
[AI describes the frameworks (SCAMPER, Six Thinking Hats, Lotus Blossom), models (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini), and the three-phase tournament structure used, citing the source documents.]

---

## Section 2: Documented Process and Observations

**Instruction:** Report the sequence of events and notable observations as documented in the source files. Use direct quotes where appropriate to maintain factual accuracy.

### 2.1 Initial Prompt Engineering:
[AI reports on the challenges and learnings from the initial prompt setup, specifically the "nine-idea limit" discovered when working with ChatGPT o3.]

### 2.2 Model-Specific Outputs:
[AI lists the factual outputs and documented scoring patterns for each model (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) as detailed in the source files.]

### 2.3 Key Finding: The Convergence Pattern
[AI describes the objective finding that all models converged on the "The Conductor: Orchestrating Human & AI Design Teams" theme, referencing the documents that state this.]

---

## Section 3: Documented Analysis and Learnings

**Instruction:** Report on the "What Worked" and "What Required Iteration" sections from the source documents.

### 3.1 Positive Outcomes:
[AI lists the documented successes of the experimental framework, such as the value of a structured scoring rubric and forced transparency.]

### 3.2 Documented Challenges:
[AI lists the documented iterations and limitations, such as the need for explicit output completeness and potential model bias.]

## Section 4: Human Insight Annotation Log

**Instruction:** Review all provided source files for any text marked with "[HUMAN...]". For each instance, copy the marker verbatim and state the file it came from. Do not attempt to write the content for these sections.
