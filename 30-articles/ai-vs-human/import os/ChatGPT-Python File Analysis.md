## Prompt:
import os.py

Python

draft-markup-languages.md

File

refined-markup-languages.md

Good to see you to, run this python on these 4 files.

Thought for 10 seconds

Reading documents

The user uploaded 5 files, but the python script refers to 4 markdown files: Draft, Refined, Edited, and Final. The files for the script are:

*   draft-markup-languages.md
    
*   refined-markup-languages.md
    
*   edited-markup-languages.md
    
*   final-markup-languages.md
    

The Python file, import os.py, seems like the script they'll be running on these 4 markdown files. I just need to be sure to run the python script on only these 4 files.

The script expects specific file paths, but the actual uploaded files don't match. I need to change the file paths in the script from:

*   "/mnt/data/01-draft-name.md"
    
*   "/mnt/data/03 - refined-name.md"
    
*   "/mnt/data/04 - edited-name.md"
    
*   "/mnt/data/05 - final-name.md"
    

To match the uploaded files like "draft-markup-languages.md". Additionally, to improve output to the user, I'll ensure the pandas DataFrames (df\_metrics, df\_trans) are presented clearly using the appropriate tool for visibility. I'll adjust the filenames and use this tool to display the analysis.

## Response:
Stage Metrics

| Stage | CharCount | WordCount | AvgSentenceLen |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Draft | 5243 | 823 | 15.8 |
| Refined | 6923 | 1097 | 16.4 |
| Edited | 7049 | 1012 | 18.8 |
| Final | 5849 | 828 | 19.3 |

Transition Analysis

| Transition | SequenceSim(%) | WordChange(%) | NewVocabCount |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Draft → Refined | 4.8 | 33.3 | 260.0 |
| Refined → Edited | 23.2 | \-7.7 | 143.0 |
| Edited → Final | 4.1 | \-18.2 | 129.0 |
| Draft → Final |  |  |  |

I’ve executed the analysis across your four document stages. You can explore:

*   **Stage Metrics**: character counts, word counts, and average sentence lengths for each draft stage.
    
*   **Transition Analysis**: structural similarity, word count changes, new vocabulary introduced between stages, plus overall semantic similarity from Draft to Final.
    

Let me know if you’d like any further insights or visualizations!

## Prompt:
I would LOVE a visualization, especially of the semantic change

## Response:
Thought for 4 seconds

The user wants a visualization that captures semantic change across the stages. We’ve got a semantic similarity value of 38.4% from Draft to Final, but for a full picture, I’ll calculate the similarity for each transition: Draft→Refined, Refined→Edited, Edited→Final, and the final Draft→Final. Each transition will get a cosine similarity score, which I can plot as a bar chart. The user clearly asked for semantic change, so that’s what I’ll focus on.

We already computed the TF-IDF and cosine similarity matrix, which is 4x4. To focus on the semantic similarity, I’ll extract pairs like \[0,1\], \[1,2\], \[2,3\], and \[0,3\], multiply

Semantic Similarity Across Draft Stages

![Output image](https://files09.oaiusercontent.com/file-UCauAotyoHmxAFbMioR1yV?se=2025-06-15T01%3A48%3A58Z&sp=r&sv=2024-08-04&sr=b&rscc=max-age%3D299%2C%20immutable%2C%20private&rscd=attachment%3B%20filename%3Dc140989a-977a-4c79-a9c6-a2e8925f5411&sig=RmK7cxZZBY3QgOu8tAGccyh5bwZMDvZcI3zAJNnf7sU%3D)

Here’s a bar chart showing semantic similarity between each pair of stages:

*   **Draft → Refined**: ~48%
    
*   **Refined → Edited**: ~80%
    
*   **Edited → Final**: ~73%
    
*   **Draft → Final**: ~38%
    

This visual highlights that the biggest semantic shift happens in the transition from Draft to Refined, while Refining to Editing preserves most of the original meaning. Let me know if you’d like additional visualizations—perhaps of structural similarity or vocabulary changes!

## Prompt:
So, if I'm following this right, the draft and final were almost the same, but it changes considerably during the refined and editing stages, semantically...

## Response:
Thought for a few seconds

It seems the user is misinterpreting the chart. They think the draft and final are nearly the same, but the chart shows that the similarity is only 38%, implying they changed the most. The real similarity is highest between the refined and edited versions, at 80%. The similarity between edited and final is 73%. So, I need to correct the user's understanding: the changes between draft and final are the most significant, not the least.

Done

Not quite—actually it’s the opposite. The **Draft → Final** bar sits at only **∼38%** similarity, which is the _lowest_ of the four, meaning your draft and your final differ the most overall. By contrast, the **Refined → Edited** transition is at **∼80%** similarity, and **Edited → Final** at **∼73%**, so those middle stages preserve most of the original meaning. The biggest semantic shift happens in that initial “Draft → Refined” step (∼48%), and overall from Draft to Final. Would you like me to chart the structural similarities or vocabulary changes next?

## Prompt:
Got it, so 62% difference.

## Response:
Exactly—since the Draft → Final similarity is about 38%, that implies roughly a 62% semantic change overall. Would you like me to visualize the structural similarity transitions or the vocabulary shifts next?
