1,250628-01-gpt4.1-template-1.md,Article Template System,"1. Establishes a template system for Long, Medium, and Short form articles with defined purposes (""Anchor,"" ""Feature,"" ""Snack"").2. Core ""Do's & Don'ts"" emphasize avoiding fabrication: ""Ask for missing detailsâ€”never invent"" and annotating gaps.3. Each template section has a stated purpose to guide the writer (e.g., ""Title: Clearly state the topic... Edit for clarity over cleverness"").4. Mandates that if information is missing, the writer must annotate with ""Author to provide..."" rather than guessing.5. An appendix provides editorial cues for integrating audience persona, visuals, and E-E-A-T details, again stressing annotation for missing input."
2,250628-02-4opus-template-1.md,Article Template System,"1. Critiques the existing system for missing a ""Human Layer,"" proposing the need for a ""Failure Anthology"" to share struggles.2. Suggests adding a ""Controversy Engine"" to inject irreverent brand opinions and ""Hot Takes"" into content.3. Introduces a content multiplication strategy where one long-form article can generate 3-5 medium and 5-15 short pieces.4. Defines a clear brand voice: ""Write like you're explaining to a smart colleague over drinks,"" skeptical of hype and honest about limitations.5. Explicitly states that the ""Human Layer"" elements (failure, controversy, vulnerability) are the editor's job to inject, as an AI cannot create them authentically."
6,250629-06-GPT4o-session.md,AI Role & Experimentation,"1. Outlines a multi-step prompt for an AI to research trends, brainstorm article ideas, and score them based on set criteria.2. The ideation phase uses three distinct creative frameworks: SCAMPER, Six Thinking Hats, and Lotus Blossom.3. Concepts are scored on three criteria: Trend Fit, Novelty, and Practical Impact, with a final ""Total Score"" determining winners.4. The AI is tasked with multiple rounds of evaluation: first generating ideas, then assessing external ideas, and finally a final adjudication.5. The winning concept from the final round was ""The Conductor: Orchestrating Human & AI Design Teams,"" chosen for its immediate and universal applicability to a core industry pain point."
7,250629-07-4Opus-session.md,Article Template System,"1. The initial problem is identified: articles try to serve all audiences at once and fail.2. A three-tier format is proposed: Full Experiment (for method seekers), Insight Article (for practical implementers), and Concept Reference (for knowledge builders).3. The user provides critical feedback that the templates are too rigid and prescriptive, calling them ""Mad fucking Libs"" and demanding flexibility.4. The refined approach focuses on templates that guide purpose, not prose, allowing the topic to determine the structure while maintaining a familial feel.5. The discussion concludes by adding an appendix of ""Editorial Elements"" (the Human Layer) that are explicitly the editor's responsibility, not the AI's."
8,250628-08-GPT4.1-role-rewrite.md,AI Role & Experimentation,"1. The initial problem is a misleading and confusing system role for an AI assistant, intended to be a collaborative author.2. A key objective is to optimize the role for authoring an article using provided materials, not creating ""Mad Libs f'ing modules"".3. A specific instruction is added to ensure the AI uses provided E-E-A-T information verbatim, with ""no improvisation or role playing,"" and flags where the user needs to provide it.4. The role is updated to require the AI to reference two documents: the main brand foundation and a specific ""ai-brand-amendment-v1.md"" clarifying the separation of duties.5. The final step in the process is converting the refined JSON role definition into a well-structured XML format."
