**Phase 1: The Standalone Script Era (`ai-writing-analyzer.py`)**
This phase, documented in the `ChatGPT-AI Writing Analyzer Help.md` log, represents your initial foray into programmatic analysis.

  * **Methodology:** You started with a single Python script (`ai-writing-analyzer.py`) that performed basic lexical analysis using `difflib`, word counts, and a simple keyword-based theme extractor.
  * **Iteration:** You quickly found this insufficient. The process involved:
    1.  Running the script and reviewing basic metrics.
    2.  Attempting a more advanced semantic analysis with LDA topic modeling, which you found difficult to interpret.
    3.  Pivoting to a clearer TF-IDF + cosine similarity metric, which provided more understandable percentage scores.
  * **Outcome:** This phase culminated in an "enhanced" script that included the Draft -\> Final semantic similarity score, but the analysis was still relatively basic.
