**Phase 2: The Pivot to a Structured Colab Framework**
This critical turning point is detailed in the `Claude-Python NLP Research in Colab.md` log. Frustrated with the limitations of the previous environment, you deliberately architected a more robust solution.

  * **Methodology:** You established a set of "non-negotiables" that would guide the rest of the project:
    1.  **Environment:** Orchestration must occur in a Colab notebook.
    2.  **I/O:** Inputs and outputs must be stored in Google Drive.
    3.  **Cost:** The solution must avoid significant costs.
    4.  **Process:** The workflow must be broken into discrete steps with checkpoints for validation.
    5.  **Core Technology:** You decided to use `SentenceTransformers` for high-quality semantic analysis, with zero manual tagging required.
