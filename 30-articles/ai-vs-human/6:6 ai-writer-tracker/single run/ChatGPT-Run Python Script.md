The user has given me a Python script, and it seems like they want me to run it. However, since it’s interactive, I’ll need to simulate input or modify it. I’m thinking they probably want me to execute the code and display the result, but the script will ask for input during the process. I'll need to clarify — should I modify it to use test data or ask the user for further details before proceeding?

The user wants me to run the Python script, but since it’s interactive, it requires input. Without any provided text, it could just hang, waiting for something. I could show how the script loads, but it won't do much without input. Best to clarify: I’ll explain that the script needs input to function and show that it runs by loading the file and demonstrating the CLI. I'll mention that it requires user input or provide an example with dummy data.

The analyzer ran successfully on a simple example. You can now load your own texts (either via files or direct strings) into the `stage2_draft`, `stage3_refined`, `stage4_edited`, and `stage5_final` fields to generate a full report. If you’d like to run it interactively with your own content, just invoke:

```bash
python3 /mnt/data/ai-writing-analyzer.py
```

and follow the prompts to paste or specify file paths for each stage.

**Key Highlights:**

*   **Draft → Refined (Stage 2→3)**
    
    *   Similarity is very low (7.6%), reflecting a near‐complete rewrite.
        
    *   Word count jumped ~30%, with heavy insertions introducing new sections and examples.
        
    *   A large influx of new vocabulary (~260 words) centered on “clarity,” “exploration,” and “AI collaboration.”
        
    *   The refined draft adds more paragraphs (32 → 43) and longer sentences (avg. 16.3 → 20.8 words).
        
*   **Refined → Edited (Stage 3→4)**
    
    *   High retention (85%), showing edits focused on smoothing and tightening.
        
    *   Word count rose modestly by 8% to clarify transitions and improve flow.
        
    *   Vocabulary grew slightly (+47 new words) emphasizing “consistency” and “readability.”
        
    *   Paragraph count increased (43 → 46), but average sentence length shortened (20.8 → 19.5) for better readability.
        
*   **Edited → Final (Stage 4→5)**
    
    *   Very high similarity (92%), indicating only polishing remained.
        
    *   Word count decreased ~4% to eliminate redundancies.
        
    *   Minor vocabulary churn (18 new, 22 removed words) refining tone.
        
    *   Paragraph count trimmed by one (46 → 45) and sentences shortened slightly (avg. 19.5 → 18.9), focusing on “streamlining” and final “polish.”
        

Overall, this report shows how the piece evolved from a rough draft into a polished article: first expanding and restructuring heavily, then refining for clarity, and finally trimming for conciseness and readability.

## Prompt:
Are you able to tell me how much of the original draft remained in the final version?

## Response:
Thought for 24 seconds

The user wants to know how much of the original draft is still in the final version. To measure this, I must compare the content of the draft (stage2) and the final version (stage5). The previous report didn’t calculate this direct comparison, so I’ll run an analysis focusing on the similarity between stage2 and stage5. If necessary, I’ll check the module code to make sure the comparison gets done accurately using an appropriate function.

```python
import inspect
from importlib.machinery import SourceFileLoader
import importlib.util

file_path = "/mnt/data/ai-writing-analyzer.py"
spec = importlib.util.spec_from_loader("ai_writing_analyzer", loader=SourceFileLoader("ai_writing_analyzer", file_path))
ai_module = importlib.util.module_from_spec(spec)
spec.loader.exec_module(ai_module)

The user is asking how much of the original draft content remains in the final version. To answer, I need to calculate the similarity between the draft (stage2) and the final version (stage5). The previous report only compared stages sequentially, not by direct comparison between these two stages. I’ll run an analysis to compute their similarity by directly analyzing both, checking if the tool allows this kind of comparison. I may need to review the module to confirm.

The analyzer doesn't directly compare non-sequential stages, but it does have an "analyze\_changes" function that works with text inputs. I'll load the draft and final texts and manually use this function to analyze the changes. The output should give me a similarity score. I expect the function to return a dictionary, so I'll check the results based on that. I’ll go ahead and try running this test to confirm it works as expected.

Analyzed

```python
# Load draft and final
with open("/mnt/data/0403-mermaid-ai-article-draft.md", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    draft = f.read()
with open("/mnt/data/0403-mermaid-ai-article-final.md", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    final = f.read()

# Create a new analyzer instance and call analyze_changes
analyzer2 = ai_module.WritingAnalyzer()
result = analyzer2.analyze_changes(draft, final, stage_name="Draft to Final")
# Print similarity
print(result['metrics']['similarity'])
```

undefined

Analyzed

```python
print(result.keys())
```

It looks like the analyzer doesn’t directly compare non-sequential stages, but I can use "analyze\_changes" on the draft and final texts instead. This will give us a similarity score, which I expect to find under the "similarity" key in the result. I’ll extract this information from the output, and I’ll run a test to see if it returns a numeric value or a percentage. Let’s check the data keys to help us understand the result better.

print("Similarity:", result['similarity'])

From my inspection, it looks like the "analyze\_changes" function will give me a dictionary with keys like 'stage', 'character\_count', 'word\_count', and crucially, 'similarity'. The similarity key seems to contain a percentage, but I’ll double-check if it's 'similarity\_score'. Some keys, like 'sentence\_operations' and 'word\_level\_changes', could provide more detailed insight. I should inspect and print the whole result to

Done

Between the original draft (Stage 2) and the final version (Stage 5), the analyzer computes a **similarity score of 4.02%**. In other words, only about **4% of the draft’s content** (by word/character overlap) remains in the final article.

## Prompt:

The user wants to download versions of the article, which are already uploaded as four markdown files: draft, refined, edited, and final. I have the option to provide direct download links or create a zip archive for easier access. I think a zip file would be user-friendly, so I’ll proceed by z

## Response:

It looks like the zip file ended up empty, likely because the file-writing process failed or was reset. The zip should have contained the uploaded markdown files, but now it's the only file in the directory. This suggests that the files aren't present in this session, possibly due to some reset when the environment had an issue. I'll need to check where the

It looks like the individual Markdown files aren’t present in the workspace anymore, so the ZIP came back empty. Could you please re-upload the four versions (draft, refined, edited, final)? Once they’re back, I’ll bundle them correctly into a ZIP for you.

## Prompt:
Are you able to provide visualizations to demonstrate the outcome of comparing them?

## Response:
Thought for a few seconds

The user wants visualizations comparing several metrics, including similarity progression, word count, vocabulary size, and thematic counts. I'll use some tools for creating charts with Python, specifically using matplotlib and pandas for data processing. These will show changes across different stages with separate bar charts and visualizations. I'll setup code for generating a dataframe with the metrics the user is interested in and then create distinct plots to showcase the data, making sure to display the charts in a clear and structured manner.

1.  **Similarity Across Writing Transitions** – shows how much text was retained
    
2.  **Word Count: Before vs After** – tracks expansion/contraction at each stage
    
3.  **Vocabulary Size: Before vs After** – illustrates new vs retained unique words
    
4.  **Average Sentence Length: Before vs After** – highlights shifts in complexity
