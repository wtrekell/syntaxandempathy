# Mermaid Mapping: Charting My Content Creation Workflow

*How AI-assisted diagramming illuminated my process and paradoxically made it more human*

I set out to create a visual diagram of my content workflow—a seemingly straightforward task. Little did I know this simple experiment would transform not just how I understand my own process, but how I approach documentation, collaboration, and systems thinking altogether.

**TL;DR:** Creating a workflow diagram in Mermaid with AI assistance proved to be both frustrating and revelatory. While the AI could **rapidly generate the initial structure** (saving 4-5x the time it would have taken manually), navigating the balance between visual thinking and code editing exposed critical insights about my creative process. The greatest value wasn't the final diagram but the forced articulation of how my work actually flows between research, authoring, and publication—revealing connections I hadn't consciously recognized.

## The Diagram as Mirror

We build systems to reflect how we think we work. But the act of mapping those systems often reveals how we *actually* work.

My initial thought was simple: "I just need a flowchart showing how I write articles." Four hours and dozens of iterations later, I had not only a comprehensive diagram, but a fundamentally different understanding of my creative process.

Here's the journey and what I learned along the way.

## Starting Simple: The AI Advantage

Having used Mermaid script before, I thought adding AI assistance would make this process even smoother. My expectations were cautiously optimistic: I knew there would be bumps given the complexity of the diagram I wanted, but I also knew AI could save me significant setup time.

The initial time savings were substantial—what would have taken me a good hour to structure manually was scaffolded in minutes. As one node led to another, the basic architecture emerged rapidly, giving me something concrete to react to and refine.

I need an end to end flow chart that demonstrates how I approach authoring articles. The process, in general, is as follows: 1. I use Perplexity AI...
```

The AI responded with a surprisingly accurate first draft, but the real work was just beginning.

## When Structure Meets Reality

The biggest surprise came when I finally dove into the code myself. The AI had stripped out much of my template formatting and written what was probably the most verbose version possible of the Mermaid syntax. For someone like me who prefers tidy code, this was jarring.

As I tried to make modifications, I discovered an important rhythm to working with AI in this context:

- **Initial structure**: AI excels here, saving hours
- **Modification**: AI struggles, often breaking what was working
- **Refinement**: Requires human intervention, especially for style preferences

My most significant learning was in how I approached the diagram itself. Initially, I tried to build the entire complex workflow at once. This led to endless revisions as each new node forced me to reconsider earlier decisions.

> "I should have approached it like writing a story or document, really. Get the skeleton out, that rough outline, use smart and concise terminology, work through it piece by piece, basically iterating and layering in the complexity."

## The Meta-Lesson: Systems Thinking Made Visible

Beyond the mechanics of diagram creation, this experiment revealed something deeper about my workflow. The process of mapping made me confront assumptions I hadn't even realized I was making.

For example, separating my workflow into distinct subgraphs—Ideation, Authoring, and Processing—forced me to recognize these as different cognitive modes. I often blur them together in practice, which creates unnecessary friction.

The archival system within the diagram (Initial Archive → Updated Archive → Final Archive) emerged not as an afterthought but as a crucial connection point between phases. This wasn't something I had consciously built, but seeing it visualized helped me understand why certain projects felt more coherent than others.

## Pro Tips for AI-Assisted Diagramming

If you're attempting something similar, here's what I wish I'd known:

1. **Use brief node names** when working with AI. Long descriptive names mean typing them repeatedly during revisions.
2. **Expect to edit the code directly**. The AI creates a solid foundation, but refinement requires manual adjustment.
3. **Start with skeleton, add complexity later**. Build the basic structure first, then layer in details iteratively.
4. **Leverage "Change All" in editors** for consistent renaming across complex diagrams.
5. **Don't assume AI will maintain structure** across updates—it may rewrite connections you want to preserve.

## Visualization as Discovery

The most powerful outcome wasn't the diagram itself, but what it revealed about my process. By making the invisible visible, I saw connections and inefficiencies I had missed for years.

The diagram didn't just document my workflow—it changed it. I now see more clearly how my roles as researcher, writer, and editor interact, and where my collaborative touchpoints need the most attention.

As much as this was a technical exercise in Mermaid and AI, it became something more profound: a conversation with myself about how I think and create. The technology was just the medium that made that conversation possible.
