# An Experiment in AI-Driven Brainstorming: From Digital Noise to Creative Consensus

### The Problem with Prompts

This story starts with a familiar frustration: a creative block. The initial challenge was to find a compelling topic for a design article, but the deeper problem was the unreliability of AI as a creative partner. Standard interactions with large language models often yield a torrent of low-quality, generic, or non-transparent results. This inefficiency, a hidden cost many designers now pay, can be called the "AI Tax"—the extra time and energy spent wrestling with prompts, verifying outputs, and correcting a machine's superficial understanding.

Furthermore, without a structured process, AI can amplify existing biases, leading to a homogenous and uninspired set of ideas. This experiment was born from a need to solve both problems: to overcome a creative hurdle and, in doing so, to design a more deliberate, transparent, and reliable method for collaborating with AI. The process itself became the article.

This document chronicles that experiment. It's a field report for UX, product, and service designers who need a repeatable framework to move beyond simple prompting and use AI as a true, auditable partner in the creative process.

### The Architect and the Arena: Designing the Experiment

Before the brainstorming could begin, the process itself had to be designed. For this, ChatGPT-3.5 was enlisted not as a participant, but as a "prompt architect." The initial conversations revealed the core challenge: left to their own devices, AI models tend to provide the easiest, not necessarily the best, answers. To counteract this, a multi-stage, competitive tournament was designed to guide the participating AIs through a structured, transparent process.

A key decision was to move from simple text prompts to a more robust XML structure. This ensured that the complex, multi-step instructions were interpreted consistently by different models. The output formats were also specified: Markdown for human readability and JSON for data portability, ensuring the results were both easy to review and reusable.

Here is a snippet of the final XML prompt structure that guided the experiment:

```xml
<prompt>
  <intro>You are a research assistant for UX, product, and service designers.</intro>
  <taskOverview>
    <step order="1">
      <title>Quick scan</title>
      Search the web for the most current topics, pain points, and emerging trends...
    </step>
    <step order="2">
      <title>Ideation</title>
      Using what you just learned, brainstorm 15 article concepts...
    </step>
    <step order="3">
      <title>Score & rank</title>
      For all 15 ideas, assign a 0–10 score for each of Trend Fit, Novelty, and Practical Impact...
    </step>
    ...
  </taskOverview>
  ...
</prompt>
```

This level of structure was critical. It shifted the interaction from a simple conversation to a defined workflow, setting the stage for a more rigorous and revealing experiment.

### The Contenders and the Frameworks: A Method to the Madness

With the experimental design in place, three leading AI models were chosen as participants in the creative tournament:

  * **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**
  * **Gemini 2.5 Pro**
  * **ChatGPT-4.1**

To ensure a diverse and comprehensive set of ideas, the AIs were instructed to use three distinct creative frameworks. This approach was chosen to provide a scaffold for their brainstorming, guiding them beyond surface-level suggestions.

#### SCAMPER

SCAMPER is an acronym for seven creative thinking techniques: Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to another use, Eliminate, and Reverse. It's a powerful method for expanding and improving upon existing ideas by asking a series of directed questions. For designers, it’s a tool to deconstruct a problem and see it from multiple, unexpected angles.

#### Six Thinking Hats

Developed by Edward de Bono, the Six Thinking Hats is a framework for looking at a decision from a variety of perspectives. Each "hat" represents a different mode of thinking (e.g., White for facts, Black for risks, Green for creativity), forcing a holistic and balanced consideration of a topic. It helps teams move beyond their default thinking styles to explore a problem more fully.

#### Lotus Blossom

The Lotus Blossom technique is a visual brainstorming method that starts with a central theme and branches out into related ideas. The core concept is placed in the center of a 3x3 grid, and the surrounding squares are filled with related sub-themes. Each of those sub-themes then becomes the center of its own 3x3 grid, allowing for a deep and structured exploration of a topic.

By grounding the experiment in these established frameworks, the AI's "creativity" was channeled in a structured, deliberate way, pushing the ideation process into more novel territory.

### The Results: A Surprising and Instructive Consensus

The multi-round tournament culminated in a final adjudication where each AI, armed with the top-scoring ideas from the previous rounds, was asked to select the single best concept. The outcome was a striking, near-unanimous decision.

  * **The Consensus:** Both **Gemini 2.5 Pro** and **ChatGPT-4.1** independently chose the same winning concept: **"The Conductor: Orchestrating Human & AI Design Teams."** This idea, which focuses on the practical challenges of managing hybrid teams, received top marks for its immediate relevance and practical impact.
  * **The Outlier:** **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** selected a different winner: **"The Post-App Era: Substituting Apps with AI Agents."** This concept, while highly innovative, was viewed by the other models as less immediately actionable for the target audience.

The strong consensus from two of the three models provides powerful validation for the winning topic. Here are the top ideas generated by each participant:

### The Unfolding Narrative: A Reflection on the Outcome

This experiment revealed that a structured, multi-round process can guide AI models toward a validated consensus, offering a powerful alternative to the randomness of single-shot prompting. The winning theme—the human designer as an *orchestrator* of AI—is particularly insightful. It suggests that the most pressing challenge in the field is not about AI replacing designers, but about creating new frameworks for human-led, AI-augmented collaboration.

A significant moment of serendipity occurred when the winning "Conductor" concept unexpectedly resonated with a previously saved article about AI orchestration. This reinforced the topic's relevance and provided a clear path forward for future writing.

However, a critical question remains: Do the AIs favor the "human as conductor" narrative because it reflects a genuine need observed in their vast training data, or is it a sophisticated form of alignment, designed to position AI as a non-threatening tool? This experiment provides a method for surfacing valuable ideas, but the deeper "why" behind the AI's choices warrants ongoing investigation.
