**My Thoughts on the Experiment**

Early last week, I was struggling to come up with an idea for whatever I was going to write. I went through a couple of ideas, really trying to figure out how to do something with an arc—maybe using different frameworks over time—but I couldn't land on anything. I’ve also been struggling to get an AI agent to work, more specifically just getting the foundational ones to actually talk to each other. I got two talking, but only partially, and I don’t know what’s wrong with that (but that’s a side quest for another time).

So instead of spinning my wheels brainstorming a new idea, I decided to write an article on using creative brainstorming with AI itself. I sat down with ChatGPT o3 and went through the process of crafting a robust prompt. I knew I wanted output as both text and JSON (so it’d be portable if I wanted to reuse it). I looked over the results and ended up with a prompt that felt solid.

This is where it got interesting. I specifically asked for a prompt that would force each AI to give me *all* the results in one shot, because I wanted to see if the outputs would get mangled, or if something weird would happen. When I reviewed the initial outputs, I noticed the prompt had somehow decided—on its own—to limit the list to nine ideas. That was never my request. (I’ll have to check my notes, but pretty sure that was the AI’s invention, not mine.)

That bugged me, because SCAMPER has seven verbs, Six Thinking Hats has six, and the Lotus Blossom method can be nearly infinite if you keep expanding. I wanted a comprehensive list, not an arbitrary cut-off. So, I had to push back and clarify that I wanted *everything*—not just three. If the AI only gave me three, I’d have no idea if I was getting the best, the worst, or (more likely, knowing how these things work) just the first three that popped out.

After some iteration, I got the full set. Then, I moved to having each AI score and pare down the list, eventually landing on 15, then 9, then 3 top ideas. Honestly, a lot of the ideas were actually things I could see myself writing about—I plan to add those to the article itself.

But the most interesting moment came in the final round. It was a little eerie: all the AIs independently picked the same article as the winner—about orchestrating human and AI design teams. When I skimmed that article, what struck me most was its framing: it talked about a *human* being the conductor, orchestrating the agents. That stood out because, in my own thinking, I’d chosen to let an *agent* be the orchestrator, with me (the human) just checking in at certain milestones.

I started thinking about how many checks an agent system would actually need to be truly autonomous. How many agents would it spawn? Would it be manageable if I had to review every little step, or would it be better if the system just brought me a draft, an edit, a result—so I could just check the milestones and not get bogged down with 50 micro-decisions?

Then, I remembered I had a Readwise article saved on this very topic, which also touched on orchestration. That piece described scenarios where the AI was the orchestra *and* the conductor—sometimes even running at a massive scale, with tens or hundreds of agents splitting off to gather information or break down a big task.

It made me pause: Am I thinking too small? Is it better to have humans orchestrate, or to let the AI run the show and just report back at intervals? Both approaches have merit—one keeps human oversight, the other leverages full AI autonomy (for better or worse).

Unfortunately, I didn’t finish that Readwise article (work got in the way), but I need to revisit it—Anthropic, in particular, is putting out some great, transparent thinking here (which I appreciate more than what I’m seeing from OpenAI lately, and possibly Google, though Gemini 2.5 Pro is slowly winning me over).

Anyway, my original plan was to write about AI agents (which is super technical and probably too deep for most readers learning frameworks or starting with agents), but the sheer serendipity of all these different sources converging on the “conductor/orchestrator” idea means I’m definitely not going to run out of article topics anytime soon. I can probably fill three or four issues just from this experience.

Let’s get into it.
