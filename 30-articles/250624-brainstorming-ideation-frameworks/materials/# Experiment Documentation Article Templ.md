**Meta-Notes for Using This Template:**
- [ANNOTATE: Author to provide ___] marks gaps needing human input
- [EXTRACT: Type] marks reusable content
- [HUMAN GUIDANCE: ___] indicates where personal experience is crucial
- Structure can flex but maintain: Problem → Method → Discovery → Implications → Application

CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:
1. Write ONLY what can be verified from the chat logs and documents
2. Use phrases like "The experiment revealed" or "The process showed" instead of personal pronouns
3. When human experience is needed, write: "At this point, [WHAT HAPPENED - INSERT HUMAN DETAIL]"

4. Never invent:
   - Emotional reactions ("frustrated", "surprised")
   - Time sequences ("after hours", "eventually")
   - Thought processes ("I realized", "It occurred to me")
   - Physical actions ("I sat down", "I reviewed")

ACCEPTABLE DOCUMENTARY PHRASES:
- "The logs show..."
- "The experiment progressed to..."
- "Analysis reveals..."
- "The data indicates..."

REQUIRED PLACEHOLDERS:
When human context is essential, use:
- [HUMAN CONTEXT: Initial motivation]
- [HUMAN REACTION: To convergence]
- [HUMAN DECISION: Between approaches]
