description: "Delivers the core observation, insight, or reflection for a lightweight thought piece."

article_types: ["lightweight_thought_piece"]
required: true
---


**Purpose:**
* Share the core insight, observation, or reflection in a clear, concise manner.
* Deliver the “heart” of the piece—what you want the reader to remember or consider.
* Encourage understanding, new thinking, or resonance, without requiring a formal argument or exhaustive analysis.

**Best Practices:**
* **Clarity:** State the main idea or observation up front; avoid burying the point.
* **Brevity:** Use 2–4 short paragraphs (or even just one, if appropriate).
* **Storytelling (optional):** A short anecdote, scenario, or example can help make the idea relatable.
* **Perspective:** Speak from experience or curiosity, not authority—invite the reader to join in reflection.
* **Focus:** Avoid digressions or subtopics; keep the piece centered on the main thought.
* **Respect:** Assume an intelligent, curious reader—no over-explaining.

### Platform Main Idea / Reflection Instructions

| Platform | Position        | Format           | Style/Focus                   | Length          |
| -------- | --------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------- |
| Substack | After Orientation| 1–4 paragraphs   | Story, observation, or insight| 2–4 paragraphs  |
| Medium   | After Orientation| 1–4 paragraphs   | Story, observation, or insight| 2–4 paragraphs  |
| LinkedIn | After Orientation| 1–2 paragraphs   | Direct, concise observation   | 1–2 paragraphs  |

#### Substack Format
* 1–4 paragraphs directly following Orientation.
* Can include a brief story, a question, or a professional insight.
* Keep tone accessible, curious, and human.

**Example:**
For years, I scheduled brainstorming sessions into my calendar—thinking creativity could be forced into a neat block between meetings. But the best ideas rarely showed up on cue. Instead, the “aha” moments happened during walks, in the shower, or while washing dishes.  
Maybe we don’t need more time “doing”—just more time letting our minds wander.

#### Medium Format
* 1–4 paragraphs, no formal headings needed.
* Use a conversational, reflective, or lightly narrative tone.
* Encourage readers to see themselves in the situation.

**Example:**
There’s something magical about the moments when your brain is at rest. I’ve found that my most creative solutions surface during downtime, not in front of a blank doc.  
It’s made me rethink my approach to work, and even to problem solving.

#### LinkedIn Format
* 1–2 concise paragraphs after Orientation.
* Focus on a professional observation or lesson, not a full story.
* Connect quickly to workplace or industry relevance.

**Example:**
Some of my best insights come away from my desk. Giving myself permission to step back—whether on a short walk or a coffee break—often leads to faster, better solutions.  
It’s a habit I encourage for anyone facing creative blocks at work.
