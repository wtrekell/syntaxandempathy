### General Purpose & Best Practices

**Purpose:**
* Clearly document how the experiment was conducted so others can understand, critique, or replicate it.
* Ensure transparency and reproducibility—clarify every major decision, tool, and variable.

**Best Practices:**
* **Structure:** Break down the approach step by step: setup, tools, data, variables, process.
* **Clarity:** Use bulleted or numbered lists where possible; visuals/screenshots for key steps.
* **Transparency:** Note any constraints or tradeoffs.
* **Audience:** Write for non-experts as well as practitioners.

### Platform Instructions

| Platform | Position      | Format                | Style/Focus       | Length         |
| -------- | -------------| --------------------- | ----------------- | -------------- |
| Substack | After Setup  | Steps or sections     | Detailed, visual  | 2–4 paragraphs/lists |
| Medium   | After Setup  | Steps or sections     | Detailed, visual  | 2–4 paragraphs/lists |
| LinkedIn | After Setup  | Brief, clear bullets  | Concise           | 1–2 paragraphs/lists |

#### Substack / Medium Example:
**Experimental Setup:**
- Platforms tested: ChatGPT, Claude, Bard
- Task: Generate user journey maps from the same brief, varying only prompt length/structure

**Step-by-Step:**
1. Drafted three prompt versions per model
2. Ran each prompt with default model settings
3. Recorded and compared outputs

#### LinkedIn Example:
Method: Compared three prompt structures across leading models; measured output accuracy and user satisfaction using standardized criteria.
