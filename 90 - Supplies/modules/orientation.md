### General Purpose & Best Practices

**Purpose:**
* Provide a clear, high-level “what” and “why” for the article, especially when the topic is technical or abstract.
* Make the topic approachable without oversimplifying or patronizing.
* Quickly answer: What is this about? Why should I care? What’s at stake?
* Offer enough conceptual grounding that less technical readers aren’t lost, while not boring or slowing down experts.

**Best Practices:**
* **Clarity:** Clearly state the article’s main focus (what) and importance (why), using plain English as much as possible.
* **Scope:** Allow for more depth than a short paragraph—up to 2–4 short paragraphs if needed, especially for technical breakdowns.
* **Audience Awareness:** Briefly call out who will get the most value (e.g., “Whether you’re a UX designer or a product manager…”).
* **Light Framing:** If technical terms must be used, give quick, non-patronizing definitions or analogies—think “side note for clarity.”
* **Layered Explanation:** Start with the simplest explanation, then add one level of technical/contextual detail for those who need it.
* **Relevance:** Tie the concept to current trends, practical use, or why it matters now.

### Platform Orientation Instructions

| Platform | Position    | Format                                | Style/Focus                       | Length         |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Substack | After TL;DR | 1–4 paragraphs, block quotes/callouts | Accessible, layered               | 2–4 paragraphs |
| Medium   | After TL;DR | 2–3 paragraphs, in-line defs/callouts | Balanced, practical               | 2–3 paragraphs |
| LinkedIn | After TL;DR | 1–2 short paragraphs                  | Business/practical, defined terms | 1–2 paragraphs |

#### Substack Format
* 1–3 short paragraphs, optionally with a block-quote or callout for a key point.
* Use white space for breathing room.
* If technical, can use an inline “quick explainer” or analogy.
* Encourage readers to skip ahead if they’re already familiar.

**Example:**
> The shift to adaptive design systems isn’t just a technical upgrade—it’s a fundamental change in how we deliver value to users.

> In plain terms, adaptive systems use AI to personalize interfaces in real time. Instead of showing every user the same buttons and layouts, these systems adjust based on behavior, preferences, and even context.

> Why does this matter? If you’re designing products today, understanding these changes will help you create more effective, satisfying experiences—without being caught off guard by the next big trend.

#### Medium Format
* 1–3 concise paragraphs, with in-line definitions or callouts.
* Balance between technical background and practical context.
* End with why the audience should care or what they’ll gain.

**Example:**
> Adaptive interfaces—sometimes called context-aware UI—are reshaping what’s possible in product design. If you haven’t worked with these systems yet, imagine a website that reorganizes itself for each visitor’s needs.

> While this technology is driven by advances in AI, you don’t need a computer science background to grasp its impact. In this piece, I’ll break down the basics and show how any designer or product lead can start thinking adaptively.

#### LinkedIn Format
* 1–2 concise, jargon-light paragraphs.
* Focused on practical implications, business value, or team outcomes.
* Technical terms always get a one-line “in context” definition.

**Example:**
> Adaptive design systems use AI to customize user experiences on the fly—meaning what your customers see is more relevant and engaging.

> This approach isn’t just for developers; product and design teams that understand it will have a real edge in delivering value and staying competitive.
