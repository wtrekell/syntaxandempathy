## **Takeaway / Closing Thought Module**

### **General Purpose & Best Practices**

**Purpose:**
* Sum up the main message or lesson in a memorable, concise way.
* Leave the reader with a final insight, question, or encouragement.
* Prompt reflection or gentle action—without a formal call-to-action or sales push.

**Best Practices:**
* **Brevity:** 1–2 sentences; keep it crisp and impactful.
* **Resonance:** Reinforce the core idea or lesson from the main body.
* **Open-ended (optional):** Pose a question or suggest a mindset shift for the reader to consider.
* **Tone:** Reflective, encouraging, or thoughtful—never heavy-handed or demanding.
* **Separation:** Place directly after the Main Idea/Reflection section, before Resources or References.
