### General Purpose & Best Practices

**Purpose:**
* Instantly capture the reader’s attention.
* Set the tone and create urgency or curiosity.
* Connect the article to a real challenge, question, or opportunity for the reader.
* Encourage the reader to keep reading—without summarizing the article or revealing conclusions.

**Best Practices:**
* **Brevity:** 2–4 sentences total (1–2 short paragraphs).
* **Connection:** Use a familiar pain point, bold statement, surprising fact, or provocative question.
* **Voice:** Direct, relatable, energetic; never condescending or clickbaity.
* **No Spoilers:** Do not give away the article’s argument, solution, or main outcome.
* **Respect:** Avoid fear-mongering, forced urgency, or self-promotion.
* **Format:** Can be a short narrative, question, or scenario—but always punchy and concise.
