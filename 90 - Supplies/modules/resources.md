### General Purpose & Best Practices

**Purpose:**
* Offer readers additional, optional materials that extend or complement the main article.
* Support deeper learning, further exploration, or access to tools and communities.
* Build trust by recommending genuinely useful, relevant resources—not just filler links.

**Best Practices:**
* **Curate Carefully:** Only include resources that add clear value or context—no irrelevant links.
* **Variety:** Mix articles, guides, videos, tools, datasets, and community links when appropriate.
* **Relevance:** Briefly explain why each resource is helpful or who would benefit most.
* **Clarity:** Use a consistent, scannable format.
* **Separation:** Keep resources separate from “References” (which are for works directly cited in your article).
* **Location:** Place after main content, after references (if included), or as a sidebar/footnote.

**Resource Format (Recommended):**
```

* **Resource Title** – 1–2 sentence description on relevance, value, or target audience. \[Link]

```

**Example:**
* **Practical Guide to Adaptive Design** – A hands-on introduction to implementing adaptive patterns in modern interfaces. Especially useful for designers just starting out. [Read the guide](https://example.com/adaptive-design-guide)
* **UX Research Community** – An active forum for UX professionals discussing the latest trends and challenges in user-centered AI. [Visit the community](https://example.com/ux-community)
* **Dataset: UI Patterns in the Wild** – Real-world examples of interface patterns from popular apps, updated monthly. [Access the dataset](https://example.com/ui-patterns-dataset)
