### General Purpose & Best Practices

**Purpose:**
* Give credit for ideas, data, or quotes cited within the article.
* Provide readers with a trustworthy trail to verify claims or explore topics further.
* Maintain professional, transparent standards in all published work.

**Best Practices:**
* **Credibility:** Include all sources you have directly referenced—studies, articles, reports, forums, etc.
* **Clarity:** Use a consistent, easy-to-read citation style (see format below).
* **Accessibility:** Include direct URLs whenever possible.
* **Order:** Number references in order of appearance within the article.
* **Separation:** Keep references distinct from “Resources” (which are for optional further reading, not directly cited).
* **Formatting:** Prefer professional, publication-ready citation style (sample below), but platform context can allow for small adaptations.
* **Location:** Place at the end of the article or in a dedicated “References” section.

**Citation Style (Recommended):**
```

\[1] Author/Organization. Year. "Title of Source." Publication or Site, Month Day, Year. <URL>

```
*You may also use your own preferred scholarly or blog-adapted format as long as it's consistent and readable.*
