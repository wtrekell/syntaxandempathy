### General Purpose & Best Practices

**Purpose:**
* Deliver a concise, standalone summary of the article’s topic, findings, and value.
* Allow readers to decide quickly if they want to read further.
* Serve busy readers and maximize value—even for skimmers.

**Best Practices:**
* **Brevity:** 1–2 sentences or a brief paragraph, optionally followed by 2–3 bullet points.
* **Coverage:** Capture the article’s core topic, main outcome or argument, and one actionable takeaway.
* **Clarity:** Use plain language; never introduce unexplained jargon.
* **Self-Contained:** The TL;DR should make sense without the rest of the article.
* **Emphasis:** Bold or highlight the most crucial point if possible.
* **Format:** Always set the TL;DR as a block quote for visibility.
