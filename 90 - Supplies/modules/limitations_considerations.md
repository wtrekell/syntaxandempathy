### General Purpose & Best Practices

**Purpose:**
* Acknowledge what your experiment can’t prove or where it may fall short.
* Build credibility by being transparent about scope and external factors.

**Best Practices:**
* **Honesty:** Clearly state limits (sample size, context, model bias, etc.).
* **Brevity:** 1 short paragraph or bulleted list.
* **Forward-looking:** Note areas for improvement or further study.

### Platform Instructions

| Platform | Position       | Format           | Style/Focus     | Length         |
| -------- | -------------- | ---------------- | --------------- | -------------- |
| Substack | After Analysis | Bullets/paragraph| Transparent     | 1 paragraph/list |
| Medium   | After Analysis | Bullets/paragraph| Transparent     | 1 paragraph/list |

#### Substack / Medium Example:
- Only three AI models tested—results may vary with others.
- User tasks limited to journey mapping; broader applications not covered.
- Findings based on current model versions as of March 2025.

#### LinkedIn Example:
Tested a limited set of models and tasks; results should be replicated before applying broadly.
