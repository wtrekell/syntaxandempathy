### General Purpose & Best Practices

**Purpose:**
* Invite reader engagement, feedback, or continued conversation.
* Encourage sharing, reflection, or discussion—without being pushy or sales-driven.
* Build a sense of connection and community around the topic.

**Best Practices:**
* **Brevity:** 1–2 sentences, direct and simple.
* **Relevance:** Tie the CTA directly to the content of the piece (e.g., “Have you experienced this?” “What works for you?”).
* **Tone:** Warm, curious, inclusive—never demanding or formulaic.
* **Variety:** Mix up your CTAs (questions, prompts for comments, suggestions for sharing or trying something new).
* **Respect:** Readers should feel invited, not obligated; avoid marketing language.
