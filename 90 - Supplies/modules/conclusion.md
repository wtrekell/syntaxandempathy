### General Purpose & Best Practices

**Purpose:**
* Provide a satisfying wrap-up that reinforces the main perspective or lesson.
* Connect the reader back to the core idea and its future relevance.
* Leave the reader with a forward-looking statement, encouragement, or gentle invitation to reflect or act.

**Best Practices:**
* **Brevity:** 1–2 short paragraphs, clear and direct.
* **Reinforcement:** Restate the essence of your perspective or main finding—no new arguments.
* **Forward-looking:** Close with a sense of what's next, or pose a question for further thought.
* **Invitation:** Optionally, encourage dialogue or self-reflection rather than a formal CTA.

#### Medium Format
* 1–2 paragraphs, summarizing the lesson or insight, and suggesting what readers might watch for or consider next.

**Example:**  
Adaptive interfaces won’t replace good design fundamentals, but they will demand a new kind of creativity. The question now is how we, as designers and product leaders, will shape this next era—by choice, not just by necessity.
