Great—your clarifications are very clear and insightful. Here’s a concise analysis and synthesis, building on your feedback and the prior template review:

---

## **What to Keep, Replace, or Rethink (Based on Your Feedback):**

### **1. Mental Model Module**

* **Current Problem:** Feels patronizing, overly didactic, or “for a 5-year-old.”
* **Action:** *Remove the current “Mental Model” as a standalone section.*
* **Purpose to Retain:** It’s supposed to provide conceptual context or scaffolding—help readers “get oriented” quickly, especially with technical or emerging topics.
* **Solution:**

  * Instead of a didactic “mental model” section, **merge this orientation/context function into a new “Executive Summary” module**.
  * This new module should offer high-level context, why-this-matters, and perhaps *one* unifying metaphor or orientation point (if truly useful), but without spelling everything out.

### **2. Hook**

* **Purpose:** Purely attention and emotional engagement—should stand alone, not be bundled with TL;DR or summary.
* **Action:** *Keep as a distinct, concise opener*—not merged with summary or context.

### **3. TL;DR**

* **Purpose:** Concise, “at a glance” summary—helps readers decide if they want to invest time.
* **Action:** *Keep as a short, high-level summary* (paragraph, bullet list, or hybrid).

### **4. Executive Summary**

* **Current State:** Used variably, sometimes as a merge of hook, TL;DR, and mental model.
* **Action:**

  * *Redefine as the “Orientation” or “Executive Context” section*—serves as a bridge between the TL;DR and the deeper article.
  * Covers: what’s at stake, relevance, audience, quick “how to use this article,” and only very light conceptual framing if needed.
  * If a metaphor or analogy is truly useful, it can live here *briefly*.

### **5. Spectacular Mistakes**

* **Your Feedback:** Ditch it.
* **Action:** *Remove from all templates.*

### **6. Resources vs. References**

* **Action:**

  * *Resources:* Further reading, tools, community links, recommended materials (not cited in the article).
  * *References:* Only what is directly cited in your article, using a professional, clear format (the one you shared works well, but I can offer modern, clean alternatives if you want).

### **7. Everything Else**

* *Assign to the most relevant sections* in each template as needed (methodology, analysis, step-by-step, outcomes, etc.).

# **Module/Section Crosswalk: What to Use Going Forward**

Here’s a more streamlined, modular breakdown for future articles/templates:

---

## **Recommended Article Module Outline**

1. **Title & Subtitle**

   * Action-oriented, clear, and accurate—minimal wordplay.

2. **Hook**

   * Short, attention-grabbing opener.

3. **TL;DR**

   * Concise, high-level summary (paragraph and/or bullets).

4. **Orientation/Executive Context**

   * Why this topic matters, what’s at stake, who it’s for, how to use the article, and optional brief metaphor or conceptual scaffold if it adds value.
   * *Not heavy-handed. No “let’s pretend you’re five” moments. Optional if context is obvious.*

5. **Main Content**

   * For experiments:

     * Background
     * Methodology
     * Results
     * Analysis/Insights
     * Ethical Considerations (if relevant)
     * Limitations
   * For step-by-step guides:

     * What You’ll Need
     * Step-by-Step Instructions
     * Pitfalls & Solutions
     * Verification/Outcomes
     * Variations & Extensions
   * For trend or thought leadership:

     * Context/Background
     * Core Argument
     * Supporting Evidence
     * Implications/Predictions
     * Counterpoints (optional, if useful)

6. **References**

   * Only what’s directly cited, using your professional format.

7. **Resources**

   * Related guides, recommended further reading, tools, community links.

8. **Call-to-Action**

   * Invitation for engagement, sharing, feedback, or further discussion.

---

## **Key Principles for These Modules**

* **No heavy-handed conceptual explanations.** Instead, lightly orient and move on.
* **Hook and TL;DR are always separate.**
* **References are clean, numbered, and formatted for credibility and readability.**
* **Resources are only for optional/extra reading, not citations.**
* **No “Spectacular Mistakes” unless a story is truly useful to learning (and then, blend into main content or skip entirely).**

## **Reference Formatting Option**

Your sample is excellent. A slightly cleaner variant (for digital ease):

> \[1] OpenAI Community. “Markdown is 15% more token efficient than JSON.” *OpenAI Developer Forum*, June 26, 2024. [Link](https://community.openai.com/t/markdown-is-15-more-token-efficient-than-json/841742)

But if you prefer your format, stick with it—it’s recognized and respected.

## **Next Steps:**

* Do you want this new outline mapped directly onto your current templates (with specific recommendations for which sections to keep/merge/remove in each)?
* Or would you like to see one fully rewritten template as an example, then adjust the rest from there?
* Any further modules you want to discuss—e.g., community spotlight, key takeaways, etc.?

Let me know your preference for next steps and any specifics you want addressed!
