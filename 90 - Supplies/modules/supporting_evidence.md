### General Purpose & Best Practices

**Purpose:**
* Back up your main argument or perspective with concrete facts, data, real-world examples, and/or credible expert opinions.
* Move beyond opinion—show why your point matters and is grounded in reality.

**Best Practices:**
* **Variety:** Mix data, case studies, brief anecdotes, expert quotes, or industry reports.
* **Relevance:** Ensure every example or data point clearly supports your main idea—no tangents.
* **Clarity:** Briefly explain why each piece of evidence is significant.
* **Visuals:** Where possible, integrate a relevant chart, screenshot, or simple visual for clarity.
