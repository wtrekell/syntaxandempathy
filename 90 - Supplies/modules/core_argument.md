### General Purpose & Best Practices

**Purpose:**
* Clearly articulate your central perspective, thesis, or key assertion.
* Distinguish your article from generic trend summaries or news.
* Frame the discussion that the rest of the article will support or explore.

**Best Practices:**
* **Clarity:** State your argument directly, in 1–2 paragraphs—don’t hide the point.
* **Originality:** Offer a unique perspective or fresh framing, even on familiar topics.
* **Connection:** Link your argument back to the Orientation/context and explain why it matters.
* **Tone:** Assertive but open—state your position, but welcome thoughtful consideration.

### Platform Core Argument Instructions

| Platform | Position              | Format        | Style/Focus           | Length        |
| -------- | --------------------- | ------------- | --------------------- | ------------- |
| Substack | After Context/Background | 1–2 paragraphs| Clear, declarative    | 1–2 paragraphs|
| Medium   | After Context/Background | 1–2 paragraphs| Direct, accessible    | 1–2 paragraphs|
| LinkedIn | After Context/Background | 1 paragraph   | Succinct, business-relevant | 1 paragraph |

#### Substack Format
* 1–2 paragraphs directly after context.
* State your position clearly, with a bold or memorable line if possible.

**Example:**  
The fundamental premise of traditional design systems—that visual and behavioral consistency across all users creates the best experience—is about to be challenged by AI-powered interfaces that adapt to individual needs, preferences, and contexts.

#### Medium Format
* 1–2 paragraphs; be clear and concise, but don’t hedge.
* Connect your argument to your own experience or industry trend, if appropriate.

**Example:**  
As designers, we’re told to pursue consistency above all. But adaptive, AI-driven components demand a new paradigm—one that values results over rigid rules.

#### LinkedIn Format
* 1 succinct, business-relevant paragraph.

**Example:**  
Uniform user experiences are being replaced by dynamic, adaptive interfaces—and the winners will be those who can balance flexibility with clarity.
