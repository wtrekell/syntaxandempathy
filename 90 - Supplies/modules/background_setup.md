### General Purpose & Best Practices

**Purpose:**
* Frame the experiment’s origin: the question, challenge, or curiosity that motivated the work.
* Situate the experiment in current context (industry problem, user need, previous research, etc.).
* Give readers just enough context to understand why this experiment is relevant and worth their time.

**Best Practices:**
* **Clarity:** Summarize the problem or opportunity you set out to explore.
* **Relevance:** Connect the experiment to a broader trend, knowledge gap, or business need.
* **Focus:** 1–2 paragraphs, avoid repeating the Orientation module.
* **Tone:** Engaged, professional, clear about the “why.”

### Platform Instructions

| Platform | Position         | Format          | Style/Focus      | Length        |
| -------- | ----------------| --------------- | ---------------- | ------------- |
| Substack | After Orientation| 1–2 paragraphs  | Context-rich     | 1–2 paragraphs|
| Medium   | After Orientation| 1–2 paragraphs  | Context-rich     | 1–2 paragraphs|
| LinkedIn | After Orientation| 1 paragraph     | Direct           | 1 paragraph   |

#### Substack / Medium Example:
When generative AI first became widely available, designers and PMs alike wondered: Would prompt length or prompt clarity have a greater impact on model accuracy? My goal was to create an experiment anyone could reproduce to answer that question for themselves.

#### LinkedIn Example:
Prompt quality is often debated in AI circles. I set out to test how structure and length affect output quality, using tools any product team can access.
