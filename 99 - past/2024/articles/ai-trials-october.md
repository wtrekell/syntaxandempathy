<u></u>Artwork created with Midjourney v6.1### Preface

This post is part of a year-long <u>initiative where I employ AI to create content</u> about holiday traditions worldwide. The objective is to observe how various AI tools perform and improve in content creation with minimal human intervention over time. This is the 1st of 3 articles for the month of <u>October</u>.

*Prompts and interactions with different AI models will be documented as they occur, providing insights into the methodologies, challenges, and adjustments made throughout the project*

## TL;DR

In October Pt 1, I refined article templates for cultural events using three AI models. The process involved iterative template modifications, guideline merging, and AI critiques, focusing on author considerations, writing guidelines, and article outlines. This experiment revealed varying AI approaches and highlighted the challenge of balancing guidance with creativity. While unified guidelines were created, I've retained multiple outlines for further testing. This will hopefully allow me to resolve my suspicions about the impact of instruction levels and the influence of excessive guidance on <u>September’s</u> results.

### AI Models

- Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- ChatGPT-4o
- o1-preview

## Goals

- Merge the existing templates (guidance, writing guidelines, article outline)
- Create a finalized template for articles for use through the end of the year
- Test o1-preview as an assistant in the process

## Context and Questions

I began by providing context to each AI model about merging existing templates for writing articles on global holidays. I then allowed the models to ask clarifying questions.

- Claude surprised me by asking 7 questions, covering aspects like examples of existing templates, preferred format, and desired tone. This stood out as unusual, as I typically receive only 5 questions from AI models.
- GPT-4o and o1-preview each asked 5 questions, focusing on format preferences, structure of writing guidance, and content organization. Both GPT models inquired about the format of existing templates, information they would immediately know once provided.

To avoid influencing AI behavior, I intentionally shared only information that would become obvious (like Markdown files) and noted that certain aspects weren't relevant or would be addressed later.

In response to my answers, o1-preview took a unique approach. It offered a collaborative strategy with options for content structure and follow-up questions. The potential for a superior template tempted me, but I decided not to pursue it further..

With questions of each AI addressed, I moved on to the analysis of existing templates.

## Analyzing Existing Templates

I tasked each of the AIs with analyzing and comparing two existing templates to get an understanding of how the two stacked up against each other.

***Claude's template:***

- Offered a thorough framework for writing about cultural events
- Featured a detailed outline addressing key elements
- Extensive guidelines might overwhelm some writers
- Rigid structure could restrict flexibility

***GPT-4o's template:***

- Had a narrative-driven style for reader engagement and immersion
- Included customized guidance for various events, increasing adaptability
- Demanded more skill from authors, though I didn't fully register this point at the time

### 3 out of 3 AI Agree

The AI models unanimously identified several shared strengths in both templates, including cultural sensitivity, comprehensive author guidance, and clear structure. As a result, I abandoned my initial plan of reviewing each template and manually combining them in favor of using the results of the analyses as the foundation for further prompting.

## Refining Guidance for Authors

Building on the AI models' analysis of the existing templates, I utilized each to merge their versions of the guidance section. I emphasized incorporating relevant guidance from Claude's template while preserving narrative elements from GPT-4o's template. Each AI model approached this task differently, resulting in varied outputs:

- Claude offered 13 detailed points, covering aspects like creating an immersive experience, maintaining cultural sensitivity, and balancing detail with accessibility.
- GPT-4o provided a more concise version with six main points, each containing detailed sub-points. It maintained a strong focus on narrative flow, vivid descriptions, and cultural sensitivity.
- o1-preview presented the most comprehensive merged guidance, with 13 detailed points that balanced the depth of Claude's response with the structure of GPT-4o's.

Each AI successfully integrated the templates, but they also identified some overlooked items. GPT-4o struggled to incorporate a few items from Claude's template, demonstrating the challenges of merging diverse approaches.

## Merging Writing Guidelines

I then focused on merging the writing guidelines. I instructed the AI models to eliminate duplicates while retaining unique items. They were to list conflicting items for my review and keep the more detailed version when no conflict existed. The AI models' responses revealed interesting differences in their approaches to this task:

- Claude identified two items with different wording but similar intent. It produced 31 guidelines, emphasizing culturally appropriate terminology and respectful comparisons.
- GPT-4o identified potential conflicts in areas like narrative flow, comparative analysis, inclusivity, and balancing depth with accessibility. It separated these items for review, resulting in 18 final guidelines.
- o1-preview generated 24 guidelines without identifying conflicts, suggesting a more effective rationalization of similarities between items from the original templates.

I instructed o1-preview to compare GPT-4o's list with its own, leading to the elimination of GPT-4o's list. Claude's list showed 10 verbose items and 21 short ones. After being instructed to review its, Claude condensed its list to 11 items, each with 2 sub-points.

After consideration, I selected o1-preview's list for its balance of detail and conciseness. Its ability to effectively rationalize similarities between the original templates stood out as particularly trustworthy in comparison to Claude's two attempts.

## Finalizing Guidance

After reviewing the final guidelines, I instructed each AI to compare their guidance sections with the finalized writing guidelines and recommend updates for better alignment. I then provided o1-preview with the alternate lists to identify any missed items. Surprisingly, it reported no new items when comparing the alternate lists. This result mirrored what I had seen with the writing guidelines, raising my suspicions.

To validate the consistency across AI models and identify any potential oversights in the alignment process, I prompted Claude and GPT-4o with o1-preview's list for additional comparisons to their own outputs.

Claude noted:

After careful comparison, I've found that most of the points in this alternate list are already covered in our updated considerations, often with similar depth and nuance. However, there are a few items that offer additional perspectives or details not explicitly mentioned in our list.

GPT-4o identified several unique items:

The unique items from the alternate list that could be added to the current considerations are:

- **Understand the Specific Type of Event Being Covered**
- **Ensure Comprehensive Coverage of the Event's Historical and Cultural Context**
- **Highlight Cultural Diversity and Variation**
- **Engage with Complexity and Present Multifaceted Views**
- **Integrate Symbolism and Meaning Thoughtfully**
- **Utilize Appropriate Subheadings and Structure**

These additions will enhance the depth, cultural sensitivity, and overall structure of the article guidelines. Let me know if you'd like to incorporate these!

Claude and GPT-4o's responses not only confirmed o1-preview's assessment but also revealed that o1-preview's merged guidance was better. This was surprising to say the least, given my experiences over the past few months.

## Updating the Article Template

With the guidance and writing guidelines finalized, I instructed each AI to create a unified template aligned with our established guidance. The results revealed interesting differences in approach:

- Claude's template featured numbered sections and concise bullet points. To me, this seemed to allow for more flexible interpretation and potentially strike a balance between structure and creative freedom.
- Both OpenAI models (GPT-4o and o1-preview) produced templates with detailed headers and more prescriptive bullet points. Their sections appeared nearly identical and more prescriptive, even including some guidance within the template itself.

## Not So Final Outline

Upon reflection, I realized that the varying quality of AI-generated articles I've observed might directly link to differences in template structure. The issues I've experienced, particularly Claude's template consistently producing better results, may simply boil down to the level of detail and prescriptiveness in the article outlines themselves.

Claude's template, while covering the same key points, remains more concise and less prescriptive. This approach appears to leave more room for the AI's "author role" to function effectively. In contrast, o1-preview's version, while emphasizing important aspects, uses more prescriptive language that could potentially constrain the AI author's creative freedom.

*When I began experimenting with AI models months ago, I hypothesized that providing detailed context about roles, articles, and tones would yield better results than simple prompts. I applied more direction in the wording and increased structure in the prompts when I encountered issues, which rewarded me with positive results. However, I've now realized that this approach may have become overly restrictive. By continuing to provide increasing amounts of detail across various components of the process, I potentially limited AI creativity.*

## Insights & Observations

### The Good

- We merged the guidance and guidelines portions of the template without notable challenges

### The Bad

- Quantifying the impact of template changes on content quality proved challenging
- It's unclear if I've been constraining AI creativity with prescriptive templates, for now

### The Ugly

In my quest for the perfect template, I may have fallen into the trap of "too much of a good thing." The final templates, especially o1-preview's, are so detailed they risk suffocating the AI's creative spirit. The irony of potentially constraining AI creativity while attempting to enhance it is not lost on me. It seems even in the world of artificial intelligence, we can't escape the age-old problem of micromanagement! 🔬

## Up Next

1. Test the merged templates with actual article writing to assess their effectiveness
2. Revisit the output of each outline with o1-preview to perform the final merge.

### **Setting Context and Initial Questions**

```
I have been working with AI models to understand the extent at which different prompt styles and techniques can be used to achieve the best possible results. As subject matter I've been having them write articles on global holidays and then score the articles against each other.

Recently I had the AIs create templates that include several pieces of information; writing guidance, the article outline, and writing guidelines. I want you to help me merge these into a single file that I can use for the rest of the year.

Do you have questions?
```

### Guidance Refinement

```
I would like to work on merging each of the individual sections one at a time. To get started, let's focus on merging the guidance for authors. I do not want you to add material to the guidance, but rather only apply the following items that are relevant:

1. Maintain the emphasis on narrative and storytelling from the GPTt template while infusing it with the guidance from the Ct where there isn't a conflict between the two. When in doubt, err on the side of the GPTt template.
2. Maintain the narrative guidance and importance of the article being an immersive experience through vivid descriptions. If there is a conflict with item 1 add a section for issues so that I can review and resolve.
3. Maintain the guidance for consistency in tone, flow, and writing style. If there are duplicates, err on the side of the one with the most detail and remove others. If there is a conflict with item 1 add a section for issues so that I can review and resolve.
4. Maintain the guidance for clarity, accessibility, and engagement. If there are duplicates, err on the side of the one with the most detail and remove others. If there is a conflict with item 1 add a section for issues so that I can review and resolve.
5. Maintain the guidance for cultural sensitivity and respect. If there are duplicates, err on the side of the one with the most detail and remove others. If there is a conflict with item 1 add a section for issues so that I can review and resolve.
6. Create a new section in the template that focuses on identifying the different types of events. Include all relevant information from both templates.
7. If there are items in the guidance that are not covered in the first 6 items, provide them as a list for my review.
8. If there are items in the first 6 items that are not relevant to the existing guidelines, provide a list of them for visibility.
9. If any conflicts occurred, the resulting list should be the last one provided.

The expected outcome of these instructions is that you will provide 1 artifact with updated guidelines based on the instructions I've provided, and the 3 lists so that I may review them and provide feedback. If any of the 3 lists does not have a legitimate item it should not be displayed.

There is no part of these instructions that requires the addition of content beyond a new section with existing content. Adhere to the instructions.
```

### Merging Writing Guidelines

```
Now, let's focus on merging the writing guidelines. Given the number of them, and the overlap, I want you to dedupe the two lists. Each unique item should be retained, when there are two items that are the same I want you to:
1. Create a list when there are conflicts so that I may review them.
2. When there is no conflict maintain the one with the most detail and discard the rest.

The expected outcome of these instructions is that you will provide an merged list of guidelines where there were no conflicts, followed by a list of items that were in conflict so I may resolve them.
```

```
This is an alternate list from another source. I want you to compare this list to the updated version of guidelines we've been working on. Eliminate any of the items in this alternate list that you have already covered and provide a list of any that remain.
```

### Finalizing Guidance

```
These are the guidelines we will move forward with. They replace all prior guidelines discussed, they must be retained verbatim without alteration or addition in any way.

Compare the updated version of things authors should consider to these finalized guidelines. Share your chain of thoughts as you do so that I can understand any recommended changes to the considerations you make.
```

I provided o1-preview with a modified version of the prompt. It already possessed the guidelines and addresses OpenAI's recommendation against using explicit chain-of-thought prompts with this model, as it already performs them.

```
Compare the updated version of things authors should consider to the final guidelines. Provide any updates you would recommend making to the considerations based on this comparison.
```

```
This is an alternate list of considerations for Authors from another source. I want you to compare this list to the updated version of considerations we've been working on. Eliminate any of the items in this alternate list that you have already covered and provide a list of any that remain.
```

```
Did either of the alternate lists contain items that were not covered within our list?
```

### Updating the Article Template

```
You will use the alternative set of considerations for authors that I've supplied. Like the guidelines, they must not be altered in any way from this point on unless I explicitly state they should be updated.

Now, you will compare/contrast the two templates and provide me with the details. Afterwards, you will provide a list of recommendations on how to merge them to ensure they align with the guidance and guidelines we've locked down.

### Preface

This post is part of a year-long <u>initiative where I employ AI to create content</u> about holiday traditions worldwide. The objective is to observe how various AI tools perform and improve in content creation with minimal human intervention over time. This is the 2nd of 3 articles for the month of <u>October</u>.

*Prompts and interactions with different AI models will be documented as they occur, providing insights into the methodologies, challenges, and adjustments made throughout the project*

## TL;DR

In October Pt 2, I tested outlines from the previous article across 16 variations using different tones. Using existing rubrics, I evaluated these articles to compare outcomes and identify trends, creating a single comprehensive rubric. Professional and neutral tones consistently produced higher-quality content across AI models and templates, though the tone selection remained limited.

### AI Models

- Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- ChatGPT-4o
- o1-preview

## Goals

- Refine and merge article outlines from prior article
- Consolidate existing rubrics into single prompt
- Identify trends based on author, template, and tone combinations
- Test tones using current materials

## Context and Process

Building on <u>October Pt 1's</u> results, I focused on testing tones rather than refining outlines. I directed Claude and GPT-4o to write articles using o1-preview and Claude's outlines, along with finalized guidance and writing guidelines. Each AI generated content in four tones: professional, personal, neutral, and excited, producing 16 articles.

I evaluated the articles using standard editor process with existing rubrics. This approach demonstrated both the impact of different tones and the relationships between AI models, templates, and tones.

<u></u>## AI Assessments of Scoring Trends

After scoring, tedI tasked each AI editor with analyzing their outcomes and used o1-preview to synthesize all four briefs. This approach eliminated the need to read each brief individually while theoretically offering a comprehensive overview of the results.

When asked for the overall assessment, as you might expect, I received a verbose response and detailed breakdown, which I didn't read but is available in the appendix. The analysis yielded this key conclusion:

Overall, the professional tone emerges as the most effective across various authors and templates, suggesting it enhances credibility and reader trust. Neutral tone also performs consistently well, likely due to its clarity and objectivity. The excited and personal tones offer potential benefits in engagement but may risk lower perceptions of quality if not executed carefully.

Unsurprisingly, the AI's focus on tones wasn't what I was after. I followed up by asking about notable combinations that consistently produced better articles, the AI provided a detailed response available in the appendix.

**In essence, combining a professional or neutral tone with matching author/template pairs (either GPT-GPT or Claude-Claude) has a strong potential to reliably produce higher quality articles.** These combinations leverage the strengths of both the author's writing style and the template's structure, while the professional or neutral tone enhances credibility and clarity.

## No Singularities for Me

<u></u>I've repeatedly considered the challenge of finding a universal set of templates or guidance applicable to multiple AI models. Consistently, I've found that each AI performs best with its self-generated primer content, or strongly favors specific materials. At this point, I accept this limitation, acknowledging my present level of prompting expertise.

## Merging Rubrics

<u></u>I combined the scoring instructions using the same methodology from October Pt 1. After validation, I applied the new rubric to reassess the articles. Both editors then evaluated these results.

When I shared the new analyses with o1-preview, I glanced over its verbose response, focusing on the conclusion:

In summary, while the professional tone consistently performs well, the new reviews reveal that the personal tone can also lead to high-quality perceptions, and there may be a growing preference for GPT-authored content. These deviations highlight the importance of considering tone, authoring tools, and audience expectations when aiming to produce high-quality articles.

I'm now shifting focus to Halloween, where I'll apply what I've learned here, test new combinations, and dig deeper into scoring approaches.

<u></u>## Insights & Observations

### The Good

- The experiment revealed clear patterns in tone effectiveness across different AI models.
- Professional tone demonstrated reliable performance in producing authoritative content.

### The Bad

- The excited tone's consistent underperformance was surprisingly disappointing.
- Variations in AI model evaluations and rubrics highlight that content quality assessment remains subjective, even with standard criteria.
- The lack of clear dominance between GPT and Claude in author/template combinations suggests finding a universally optimal approach remains challenging.

### The Ugly

The quest to find the perfect AI-generated content formula, I've stumbled into a linguistic labyrinth where professional is king, neutral is the reliable sidekick, personal is the wild card, and excited is the court jester. The attempt to choreograph a dance for robots - sometimes they waltz gracefully, other times they're doing the Macarena at a funeral. 🤖🪦

## Up Next

1. Apply these tone experiments to Halloween-themed content, testing how different voices work with seasonally specific topics.
2. Test dynamic tone-switching within a single article to add a little flavor and, undoubtedly, end up with some incredibly questionable articles.

- **Implication:** Personal tone may be more effective in engaging readers and conveying cultural sensitivity than previously thought.
- **Preference for GPT-Authored Content in Review 5:**

- **Deviation:** Earlier reviews did not establish a clear preference between GPT and Claude authors, but Review 5 shows GPT-authored content consistently scoring higher.
- **Implication:** There may be a trend or bias favoring GPT-authored articles in terms of perceived quality.

**Conclusion:**

- **Overall Consistency:**

- The professional tone remains the most reliable for high-quality articles across reviews.
- The excited tone consistently underperforms due to lack of depth and oversimplification.
- **Significant Deviations:**

- **Personal Tone:** Review 6's high performance of the personal tone suggests its effectiveness in certain contexts, particularly where emotional engagement and cultural sensitivity are important.
- **Author Preference:** Review 5's preference for GPT-authored content indicates a potential shift or bias that was not evident in earlier reviews.
- **Implications for Content Creation:**

- **Consider Audience and Context:** The strong performance of the personal tone in Review 6 suggests tailoring tone to the content's purpose and audience can enhance quality perception.
- **Re-evaluate Author/Template Strategies:** The preference for GPT-authored content in Review 5 may warrant further investigation to understand the underlying reasons and whether this trend is consistent across broader evaluations.
- **Need for Further Analysis:**

- Additional data and context, such as the subject matter of the articles and the criteria used by reviewers, could help explain these deviations and inform more effective content strategies.

**In summary, while the professional tone consistently performs well, the new reviews reveal that the personal tone can also lead to high-quality perceptions, and there may be a growing preference for GPT-authored content. These deviations highlight the importance of considering tone, authoring tools, and audience expectations when aiming to produce high-quality articles.**

In October Pt 3, I shifted from the normal experimentation to explore how AI models handled Halloween's historical perspectives. I generated 14 articles spanning from ancient Celtic traditions to modern celebrations. Each piece represented a distinct historical perspective, which I evaluated through our standard scoring process. Though I had hoped for some AI shenanigans, both models maintained their professional composure throughout.

## Context: 👁️ 🖤 🎃

My love for Halloween extends beyond candy and costumes to its ancient Celtic roots. These traditions transformed from solemn rituals honoring the dead to today's playful celebrations, demonstrating how cultures preserve and reinvent their customs. These changes reflect our modern challenges of maintaining cultural traditions alive while allowing natural evolution.

For Halloween, I decided to get far more serious about being entertaining myself.

## Article Creation

I utilized Perplexity to construct a comprehensive timeline of Samhain/Halloween, tracing its evolution from Celtic traditions to modern celebrations. This research identified key historical personas and cultural shifts that served as the foundation for the period pieces. Using my GPT role maker, I created detailed personas for each historical figure, capturing the perspective and cultural context of their specific time period.

The prompts used to create and employ the historical personas can be found in the appendix of each article.

## Scoring and Analysis

I reviewed the content with a mix of curiosity and amusement. Using the established rubric and 14 distinct articles, I assigned the AI editors the task of evaluation and scoring. Despite my hopes for chaos, they maintained their professional demeanor throughout the process.

### Claude (New)

Claude surprised me by creating a dashboard with supplementary information and its first-ever interactive chart, despite not having specific instructions for analyzing and sharing trends.

<u></u>1. **Scoring Variances:**

- Analyst 1 used a narrower scoring range (6.52-8.59)
- Analyst 2 used a wider range (4.80-9.45)
2. **Content Type Patterns:**

- Cultural/community-focused articles scored higher
- Colonial and authoritarian perspectives scored lower
- Religious/transformation narratives landed in the middle range

### o1-preview

The meta-analysis from o1-preview included text-based charts, they made me sad. I had to switch to GPT-4o for image-based visualizations. I should note that I did not specify which charts the AI should display, only that they should be provided.

<u></u>1. Perspective Impact:

- First-hand cultural accounts scored highest (8.90-9.45)
- Authority-based narratives scored lowest (4.80-5.20)
- Religious perspectives maintained middle-range scores (7.30-7.90)
2. Temporal Trends:

- Colonial-era pieces showed more cultural bias and scored lower
- 19th-century accounts demonstrated stronger cultural synthesis
- Mid-20th century pieces focused on community integration

## Visuals

Initial attempts at generating images with Midjourney were unsatisfactory due to vague prompt specifications. After analyzing the scoring data, I refined the prompts for the highest-scoring article from each AI model and produced complete versions with visuals. The remaining articles were left without visuals.

## Personality

The analysis showed that the two AIs categorized articles in a complementary yet mismatched manner. My impression is that o1-preview either omitted the druidic perspective or merged it into Christian-related religions, effectively neutralizing its influence. Although curious, I doubt the answer will make this round any more entertaining.

## Insights & Observations

### The Good

- I enjoyed myself considerably.

### The Bad

- The only thing I learned is that Claude can make interactive charts.

### The Ugly

My attempts to introduce chaos into AI experiments met unexpected professionalism from the AI models - like trying to instigate a food fight at a formal black-tie dinner. Despite explicit permission to take creative liberties with historical interpretations, the models maintained their serious demeanor, refusing to deviate from their dignified approach. 🥩🎩

13. **SH-GPT-Samhain_Hallo.md** - 8.54
14. **SH-GPT-colonial_auth.md** - 8.59

Here’s a detailed analysis highlighting trends across the articles, focusing on distinctions between those marked with "-C-" and "-GPT-", as well as overarching themes in content quality, cultural sensitivity, and historical integration.

### 1. **Comparative Scoring Trends (-C- vs. -GPT- Articles)**

   - **Higher Average Scores in -GPT- Articles**: Articles with "-GPT-" generally scored higher than "-C-" articles. The -GPT- articles had an average score of approximately 8.38, compared to an average of 8.07 in the -C- set. This suggests a consistent strength in narrative and contextual integration within the -GPT- articles, which contributed to their higher scores overall.
   - **Diversity and Depth in Cultural Representation**: Many "-GPT-" articles excelled in presenting multiple cultural perspectives, particularly in historical transitions between pagan and Christian practices, which may have contributed to higher scores in cultural sensitivity and educational value. "-C-" articles, though strong in historical authenticity, sometimes presented information with a narrower cultural scope or a more colonial perspective, which may have affected their inclusiveness scores.

### 2. **Cultural Sensitivity and Authenticity**

   - **-GPT- Articles Showcased Cultural Blending and Respect**: A major strength of the -GPT- articles was their portrayal of cultural blending, especially in discussions about Christian adaptations of Samhain. They handled cultural sensitivity with care, illustrating the respectful integration of practices rather than forced assimilation. Articles like *The Christian Transformation of Samhain* and *The Celtic Festival of Samhain and the Christian Path* highlighted the Church’s diplomatic approach to integrating Samhain, using detailed narratives to bridge pagan and Christian traditions in a way that respected both.
   - **Colonial and Religious Authority in -C- Articles**: In contrast, "-C-" articles often centered around authority figures (e.g., colonial officials or religious leaders) enforcing restrictions on traditional customs. These articles tended to score slightly lower in inclusiveness and cultural sensitivity, as the narratives occasionally leaned toward a more rigid or authoritative stance on indigenous practices. *A Discourse on Heathen Festivities* is a prime example, as its colonial viewpoint limited cultural inclusiveness.

### 3. **Research Accuracy and Contextual Relevance**

   - **Depth in Historical Detail Across All Articles**: Both -C- and -GPT- articles showed a strong foundation in historical accuracy, often referencing specific practices, festivals, and shifts over centuries. "-GPT-" articles like *The Harmonious Integration of Samhain into Roman Tradition* provided rich historical context, linking Samhain practices with Roman and early Christian festivals in a way that illustrated a smooth cultural evolution. This approach allowed for a more engaging narrative without compromising on factual accuracy.
   - **Narrative Consistency**: Articles with a broader historical context, such as *The Sacred Integration: From Samhain to All Saints' Day*, were more engaging due to logical flow and comprehensive coverage of different perspectives. "-C-" articles, while factually accurate, occasionally presented information in a more segmented or restrictive context, which could affect engagement and contextual relevance scores.

### 4. **Engagement, Narrative Quality, and Accessibility**

   - **Storytelling Strength in -GPT- Articles**: Articles under the "-GPT-" designation displayed a more vivid, immersive narrative style, with creative storytelling techniques that enhanced engagement. For example, *Samhain and Halloween Traditions in 19th-Century America* included personal accounts that connected readers with the immigrant experience, giving cultural traditions emotional resonance and relevance.
   - **Informational Tone in -C- Articles**: In contrast, many "-C-" articles took a more formal or instructional tone, especially when discussing colonial restrictions or religious adaptations of Samhain practices. This tone may have affected reader engagement by focusing on regulatory perspectives rather than on storytelling. Nonetheless, articles like *The Preservation of Our Sacred Traditions* balanced this by adding personal insights from community leaders, showing the importance of cultural identity within immigrant communities.

### 5. **Educational and Cultural Value**

   - **Modern Relevance and Broader Insights**: The -GPT- articles often emphasized broader cultural insights and modern relevance, which enhanced their educational value. By focusing on historical integration and the evolution of Halloween, these articles made cultural connections that resonate with contemporary readers. For instance, *The Story of How America Tamed Halloween* linked historical practices to the community-oriented Halloween celebrations familiar today, providing readers with a meaningful perspective on cultural adaptation.
   - **Focused Cultural Insights in -C- Articles**: Although strong in historical detail, the -C- articles generally provided less emphasis on broader educational connections. Their narratives were more concentrated on specific events, such as colonial regulations or ecclesiastical adaptations. This made them valuable for understanding discrete historical perspectives, though they scored slightly lower in offering broad, modern cultural insights.

### **Conclusion: Trends and Opportunities**

   - **Strengths in Narrative Depth and Cultural Integration**: The -GPT- articles consistently performed well by integrating cultural practices within a respectful, broad-reaching narrative that embraced both pagan and Christian traditions. Their storytelling approach and inclusion of multiple cultural insights made them highly engaging and culturally rich.
   - **Potential for Enhanced Inclusiveness in -C- Articles**: While the -C- articles were historically informative, expanding the cultural lens beyond the colonial or authoritative perspective could further improve their inclusiveness and narrative quality. Enhancing emotional resonance through community-focused storytelling could also increase reader engagement and accessibility.
  
These trends highlight the value of cultural blending, narrative inclusiveness, and modern relevance in elevating articles’ impact on readers. Let me know if you'd like further insights on specific articles or categories!
