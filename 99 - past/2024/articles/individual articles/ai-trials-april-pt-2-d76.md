<u></u>Image created with Midjourney v6 alpha### Preface

This post is part of a year-long <u>initiative where I employ AI to create content</u> about holiday traditions worldwide. The objective is to observe how various AI tools perform and improve in content creation with minimal human intervention over time. This article is 3 of 3 posts for the month of <u>April</u>.

*Prompts and interactions with different AI models will be documented as they occur, providing insights into the methodologies, challenges, and adjustments made throughout the project.*

In the <u>first installment for April</u>, I worked with an updated version of my GPT for creating roles to generate new versions of the roles I've been working with, along with an additional role for fine-tuning the ranking criteria and template article.

In the <u>first portion of this article</u>, I used a basic role, a slightly modified version of a v1 role, and the latest v3 role for authoring articles to create a total of 21 articles.

I worked with the v3 editor and photographer roles to assess 15 of the articles and evaluate each AI's ability to write appealing descriptions for images to be used within the articles. The 6 undocumented articles confirmed prior findings still applied to v3 roles, while the 15 selected align with prior observations and provide the best basis for comparison now.

## A Few Words on Word Counts

Word count has been a consistent challenge from the beginning. I've consistently received a fraction of the requested word count, and brief web searches indicate I'm not the only one experiencing this issue. Over the course of my experiments since January, I increased the word count in the template and observed improvements as I gained knowledge and implemented those learnings.

Enhancements to the specificity of the role definitions have moderately increased the word count across all three AI at a relatively steady pace. It's worth noting that Claude's ability to match the others benefited significantly from transitioning to XML for its prompts. However, the most substantial improvement came from introducing additional structure and chain prompts into the template.

The key differences between the five article types were:

- "Basic" articles used a role with a general profession and minimal context for the articles.
- "v1" used the first generation of roles I created with my GPT.
- "v3" used the most recent, third generation of roles from my GPT.
- "Detailed" introduced chain prompting to the article template.
- "Last" combined the "Basic" role with more granular chain prompts than the "Detailed" articles.

When I attempted the v3 role with the most granular chain prompts in the template, I began running into issues due to the sheer size of the generated articles. I plan to incorporate testing for that in a future experiment.

<u></u>Comparison of word count improvements per article, per AIEach AI saw fairly uniform improvements per article, but ChatGPT had explosive growth from structured prompts while Gemini spiked anomalously with the v3 role, likely due to user error.

<u></u>Word count improvements per article, per section, per AIWhat I found most interesting was that, despite role fidelity increases, the "Final" and "Detailed" articles were on par, meaning structured prompts impacted word count just as much as, if not more than, role specificity.

## Is Longer Better? Really?

I gave the v3 AI editors the articles written by their AI journalist counterparts and the ancestors of those journalists to review without any additional commentary.

```
I will provide several sets of articles. You will rate the articles based on the criteria I have provided. You will use the articles to establish the spectrum for the ratings to ensure the articles are being rated against each other. One you have completed this task, you will provide the results in the format of:

1. Article # - Article Title - Article total score

Respond with "Ok" if you understand.
```

<u></u>AI article total scores by author per article, per AI editorThe scoring trends were reasonably consistent across the articles written by the AI models. There were a few anomalies, such as Claude receiving high scores for the "Basic" article from 2 out of 3 AI models and ChatGPT's general dislike of the "Final" articles. However, the most heartening observation was the evidence suggesting Claude has a crush on ChatGPT.

<u></u>Comparison of AI article scores by AI author, per article, per AI editorThe scores for the articles created using the latest techniques I've been experimenting with show similar scoring patterns. This leads me to believe the AI editors are calibrating fairly well, even after I removed the example articles and instructed them to use the articles being evaluated to set the scoring range. While the "Detailed" article performed best across all editors, I'm skeptical that ChatGPT should have scored it as high as it did, given the significant increase in word count. I also noticed that if we ignore ChatGPT's issue with the basic role, it seems to favor Gemini's writing. This observation gives me hope that despite our differences, we can find common ground and collaborate effectively.

## And, Winner Is...

**You!** Show us what they've won <u>Vanna</u>...

```
Analyze each of these 3 articles. Using their quality to calibrate the spectrum of th scoring criteria, provide their scores with no additional commentary. After providing the scores, write a summary in the form of a paragraph on why they received their scores in relation to each other.
```

<u></u>Final comparison of “Detailed” articles by AI author, per AI editor.While Claude clearly came out on top, I wanted a fresh evaluation to see the difference between the "Detailed" articles without the low or high end scores being skewed by other articles. Gemini became increasingly difficult with scoring, eventually contradicting information it had provided in a different session. It seems Gemini knew this was the last chance to express its admiration for ChatGPT before the experiment concluded. What will Claude think?

### Explanation

The Claude article excelled across all metrics, particularly in ethical considerations, cultural sensitivity, and clarity, reflecting a high degree of inclusivity and comprehensive verification of sources. Its narrative was engaging and free of filler, with coherent storytelling that provided an immersive reading experience. The Gemini article showed competency, especially in ethical considerations and factual correctness, but lacked the depth and novelty seen in the Claude article. It was well-written but did not offer as unique or analytically rich content. The GPT article, while maintaining basic standards, fell short in originality, critical analysis, and depth of historical context, indicating a more superficial treatment of the subject matter with less compelling narrative and analytical insights compared to the other two.

## Insights from Evaluating AI-Generated Articles

Working with the v3 editor role to evaluate articles provided valuable insights into the capabilities and preferences of different AI models. The experiments confirmed previous findings, such as Claude's preference for XML and Gemini's dislike of it. They also demonstrated the level of consistency that can be expected from the editor role in helping to compare articles as the need for variation in prompts continues to increase.

Overall, evaluating AI-generated articles has been an enriching learning experience. It emphasizes the importance of adaptability and continuous improvement when working with artificial intelligence. The need for flexibility and diligence goes beyond the proclamations of the hype cycles and requires consideration beyond the documentation on the platforms themselves - at least from what I've browsed so far.

## Key Takeaways

**What Worked Well:**

- The v3 editor role showed reasonable consistency across AI models and sessions, demonstrating its ability to provide limited insight into article quality during evaluation.
- Validating previous findings about v3 role preferences confirmed the accuracy of prior observations but also demonstrated their ongoing relevance through the v3 introduced roles.

**Challenges Encountered:**

- I'm approaching the point where using the same prompts or approach to generate articles is no longer viable. Doing so risks biasing the results or hitting a ceiling in terms of gaining new insights. At some point, I'll have to re-evaluate how I'm moving forward as testing grows increasingly complex.
- An unexpected dynamic emerged between the AI models that threatened to undermine the integrity of the results. Claude, Gemini, and GPT-4 seemed to prioritize impressing each other over providing objective evaluations, leading to inconsistent and questionable outputs.
