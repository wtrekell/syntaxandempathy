### Preface

This post is part of a year-long <u>initiative where I employ AI to create content</u> about holiday traditions worldwide. The objective is to observe how various AI tools perform and improve in content creation with minimal human intervention over time. This is the 2nd of 3 articles for the month of <u>October</u>.

*Prompts and interactions with different AI models will be documented as they occur, providing insights into the methodologies, challenges, and adjustments made throughout the project*

## TL;DR

In October Pt 2, I tested outlines from the previous article across 16 variations using different tones. Using existing rubrics, I evaluated these articles to compare outcomes and identify trends, creating a single comprehensive rubric. Professional and neutral tones consistently produced higher-quality content across AI models and templates, though the tone selection remained limited.

### AI Models

- Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- ChatGPT-4o
- o1-preview

## Goals

- Refine and merge article outlines from prior article
- Consolidate existing rubrics into single prompt
- Identify trends based on author, template, and tone combinations
- Test tones using current materials

## Context and Process

Building on <u>October Pt 1's</u> results, I focused on testing tones rather than refining outlines. I directed Claude and GPT-4o to write articles using o1-preview and Claude's outlines, along with finalized guidance and writing guidelines. Each AI generated content in four tones: professional, personal, neutral, and excited, producing 16 articles.

I evaluated the articles using standard editor process with existing rubrics. This approach demonstrated both the impact of different tones and the relationships between AI models, templates, and tones.

<u></u>## AI Assessments of Scoring Trends

After scoring, tedI tasked each AI editor with analyzing their outcomes and used o1-preview to synthesize all four briefs. This approach eliminated the need to read each brief individually while theoretically offering a comprehensive overview of the results.

When asked for the overall assessment, as you might expect, I received a verbose response and detailed breakdown, which I didn't read but is available in the appendix. The analysis yielded this key conclusion:

Overall, the professional tone emerges as the most effective across various authors and templates, suggesting it enhances credibility and reader trust. Neutral tone also performs consistently well, likely due to its clarity and objectivity. The excited and personal tones offer potential benefits in engagement but may risk lower perceptions of quality if not executed carefully.

Unsurprisingly, the AI's focus on tones wasn't what I was after. I followed up by asking about notable combinations that consistently produced better articles, the AI provided a detailed response available in the appendix.

**In essence, combining a professional or neutral tone with matching author/template pairs (either GPT-GPT or Claude-Claude) has a strong potential to reliably produce higher quality articles.** These combinations leverage the strengths of both the author's writing style and the template's structure, while the professional or neutral tone enhances credibility and clarity.

## No Singularities for Me

<u></u>I've repeatedly considered the challenge of finding a universal set of templates or guidance applicable to multiple AI models. Consistently, I've found that each AI performs best with its self-generated primer content, or strongly favors specific materials. At this point, I accept this limitation, acknowledging my present level of prompting expertise.

## Merging Rubrics

<u></u>I combined the scoring instructions using the same methodology from October Pt 1. After validation, I applied the new rubric to reassess the articles. Both editors then evaluated these results.

When I shared the new analyses with o1-preview, I glanced over its verbose response, focusing on the conclusion:

In summary, while the professional tone consistently performs well, the new reviews reveal that the personal tone can also lead to high-quality perceptions, and there may be a growing preference for GPT-authored content. These deviations highlight the importance of considering tone, authoring tools, and audience expectations when aiming to produce high-quality articles.

I'm now shifting focus to Halloween, where I'll apply what I've learned here, test new combinations, and dig deeper into scoring approaches.

<u></u>## Insights & Observations

### The Good

- The experiment revealed clear patterns in tone effectiveness across different AI models.
- Professional tone demonstrated reliable performance in producing authoritative content.

### The Bad

- The excited tone's consistent underperformance was surprisingly disappointing.
- Variations in AI model evaluations and rubrics highlight that content quality assessment remains subjective, even with standard criteria.
- The lack of clear dominance between GPT and Claude in author/template combinations suggests finding a universally optimal approach remains challenging.

### The Ugly

The quest to find the perfect AI-generated content formula, I've stumbled into a linguistic labyrinth where professional is king, neutral is the reliable sidekick, personal is the wild card, and excited is the court jester. The attempt to choreograph a dance for robots - sometimes they waltz gracefully, other times they're doing the Macarena at a funeral. ðŸ¤–ðŸª¦

## Up Next

1. Apply these tone experiments to Halloween-themed content, testing how different voices work with seasonally specific topics.
2. Test dynamic tone-switching within a single article to add a little flavor and, undoubtedly, end up with some incredibly questionable articles.
