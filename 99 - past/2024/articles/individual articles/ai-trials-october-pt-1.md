<u></u>Artwork created with Midjourney v6.1### Preface

This post is part of a year-long <u>initiative where I employ AI to create content</u> about holiday traditions worldwide. The objective is to observe how various AI tools perform and improve in content creation with minimal human intervention over time. This is the 1st of 3 articles for the month of <u>October</u>.

*Prompts and interactions with different AI models will be documented as they occur, providing insights into the methodologies, challenges, and adjustments made throughout the project*

## TL;DR

In October Pt 1, I refined article templates for cultural events using three AI models. The process involved iterative template modifications, guideline merging, and AI critiques, focusing on author considerations, writing guidelines, and article outlines. This experiment revealed varying AI approaches and highlighted the challenge of balancing guidance with creativity. While unified guidelines were created, I've retained multiple outlines for further testing. This will hopefully allow me to resolve my suspicions about the impact of instruction levels and the influence of excessive guidance on <u>Septemberâ€™s</u> results.

### AI Models

- Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- ChatGPT-4o
- o1-preview

## Goals

- Merge the existing templates (guidance, writing guidelines, article outline)
- Create a finalized template for articles for use through the end of the year
- Test o1-preview as an assistant in the process

## Context and Questions

I began by providing context to each AI model about merging existing templates for writing articles on global holidays. I then allowed the models to ask clarifying questions.

- Claude surprised me by asking 7 questions, covering aspects like examples of existing templates, preferred format, and desired tone. This stood out as unusual, as I typically receive only 5 questions from AI models.
- GPT-4o and o1-preview each asked 5 questions, focusing on format preferences, structure of writing guidance, and content organization. Both GPT models inquired about the format of existing templates, information they would immediately know once provided.

To avoid influencing AI behavior, I intentionally shared only information that would become obvious (like Markdown files) and noted that certain aspects weren't relevant or would be addressed later.

In response to my answers, o1-preview took a unique approach. It offered a collaborative strategy with options for content structure and follow-up questions. The potential for a superior template tempted me, but I decided not to pursue it further..

With questions of each AI addressed, I moved on to the analysis of existing templates.

## Analyzing Existing Templates

I tasked each of the AIs with analyzing and comparing two existing templates to get an understanding of how the two stacked up against each other.

***Claude's template:***

- Offered a thorough framework for writing about cultural events
- Featured a detailed outline addressing key elements
- Extensive guidelines might overwhelm some writers
- Rigid structure could restrict flexibility

***GPT-4o's template:***

- Had a narrative-driven style for reader engagement and immersion
- Included customized guidance for various events, increasing adaptability
- Demanded more skill from authors, though I didn't fully register this point at the time

### 3 out of 3 AI Agree

The AI models unanimously identified several shared strengths in both templates, including cultural sensitivity, comprehensive author guidance, and clear structure. As a result, I abandoned my initial plan of reviewing each template and manually combining them in favor of using the results of the analyses as the foundation for further prompting.

## Refining Guidance for Authors

Building on the AI models' analysis of the existing templates, I utilized each to merge their versions of the guidance section. I emphasized incorporating relevant guidance from Claude's template while preserving narrative elements from GPT-4o's template. Each AI model approached this task differently, resulting in varied outputs:

- Claude offered 13 detailed points, covering aspects like creating an immersive experience, maintaining cultural sensitivity, and balancing detail with accessibility.
- GPT-4o provided a more concise version with six main points, each containing detailed sub-points. It maintained a strong focus on narrative flow, vivid descriptions, and cultural sensitivity.
- o1-preview presented the most comprehensive merged guidance, with 13 detailed points that balanced the depth of Claude's response with the structure of GPT-4o's.

Each AI successfully integrated the templates, but they also identified some overlooked items. GPT-4o struggled to incorporate a few items from Claude's template, demonstrating the challenges of merging diverse approaches.

## Merging Writing Guidelines

I then focused on merging the writing guidelines. I instructed the AI models to eliminate duplicates while retaining unique items. They were to list conflicting items for my review and keep the more detailed version when no conflict existed. The AI models' responses revealed interesting differences in their approaches to this task:

- Claude identified two items with different wording but similar intent. It produced 31 guidelines, emphasizing culturally appropriate terminology and respectful comparisons.
- GPT-4o identified potential conflicts in areas like narrative flow, comparative analysis, inclusivity, and balancing depth with accessibility. It separated these items for review, resulting in 18 final guidelines.
- o1-preview generated 24 guidelines without identifying conflicts, suggesting a more effective rationalization of similarities between items from the original templates.

I instructed o1-preview to compare GPT-4o's list with its own, leading to the elimination of GPT-4o's list. Claude's list showed 10 verbose items and 21 short ones. After being instructed to review its, Claude condensed its list to 11 items, each with 2 sub-points.

After consideration, I selected o1-preview's list for its balance of detail and conciseness. Its ability to effectively rationalize similarities between the original templates stood out as particularly trustworthy in comparison to Claude's two attempts.

## Finalizing Guidance

After reviewing the final guidelines, I instructed each AI to compare their guidance sections with the finalized writing guidelines and recommend updates for better alignment. I then provided o1-preview with the alternate lists to identify any missed items. Surprisingly, it reported no new items when comparing the alternate lists. This result mirrored what I had seen with the writing guidelines, raising my suspicions.

To validate the consistency across AI models and identify any potential oversights in the alignment process, I prompted Claude and GPT-4o with o1-preview's list for additional comparisons to their own outputs.

Claude noted:

After careful comparison, I've found that most of the points in this alternate list are already covered in our updated considerations, often with similar depth and nuance. However, there are a few items that offer additional perspectives or details not explicitly mentioned in our list.

GPT-4o identified several unique items:

The unique items from the alternate list that could be added to the current considerations are:

- **Understand the Specific Type of Event Being Covered**
- **Ensure Comprehensive Coverage of the Event's Historical and Cultural Context**
- **Highlight Cultural Diversity and Variation**
- **Engage with Complexity and Present Multifaceted Views**
- **Integrate Symbolism and Meaning Thoughtfully**
- **Utilize Appropriate Subheadings and Structure**

These additions will enhance the depth, cultural sensitivity, and overall structure of the article guidelines. Let me know if you'd like to incorporate these!

Claude and GPT-4o's responses not only confirmed o1-preview's assessment but also revealed that o1-preview's merged guidance was better. This was surprising to say the least, given my experiences over the past few months.

## Updating the Article Template

With the guidance and writing guidelines finalized, I instructed each AI to create a unified template aligned with our established guidance. The results revealed interesting differences in approach:

- Claude's template featured numbered sections and concise bullet points. To me, this seemed to allow for more flexible interpretation and potentially strike a balance between structure and creative freedom.
- Both OpenAI models (GPT-4o and o1-preview) produced templates with detailed headers and more prescriptive bullet points. Their sections appeared nearly identical and more prescriptive, even including some guidance within the template itself.

## Not So Final Outline

Upon reflection, I realized that the varying quality of AI-generated articles I've observed might directly link to differences in template structure. The issues I've experienced, particularly Claude's template consistently producing better results, may simply boil down to the level of detail and prescriptiveness in the article outlines themselves.

Claude's template, while covering the same key points, remains more concise and less prescriptive. This approach appears to leave more room for the AI's "author role" to function effectively. In contrast, o1-preview's version, while emphasizing important aspects, uses more prescriptive language that could potentially constrain the AI author's creative freedom.

*When I began experimenting with AI models months ago, I hypothesized that providing detailed context about roles, articles, and tones would yield better results than simple prompts. I applied more direction in the wording and increased structure in the prompts when I encountered issues, which rewarded me with positive results. However, I've now realized that this approach may have become overly restrictive. By continuing to provide increasing amounts of detail across various components of the process, I potentially limited AI creativity.*

## Insights & Observations

### The Good

- We merged the guidance and guidelines portions of the template without notable challenges

### The Bad

- Quantifying the impact of template changes on content quality proved challenging
- It's unclear if I've been constraining AI creativity with prescriptive templates, for now

### The Ugly

In my quest for the perfect template, I may have fallen into the trap of "too much of a good thing." The final templates, especially o1-preview's, are so detailed they risk suffocating the AI's creative spirit. The irony of potentially constraining AI creativity while attempting to enhance it is not lost on me. It seems even in the world of artificial intelligence, we can't escape the age-old problem of micromanagement! ðŸ”¬

## Up Next

1. Test the merged templates with actual article writing to assess their effectiveness
2. Revisit the output of each outline with o1-preview to perform the final merge.

### **Setting Context and Initial Questions**

```
I have been working with AI models to understand the extent at which different prompt styles and techniques can be used to achieve the best possible results. As subject matter I've been having them write articles on global holidays and then score the articles against each other.

Recently I had the AIs create templates that include several pieces of information; writing guidance, the article outline, and writing guidelines. I want you to help me merge these into a single file that I can use for the rest of the year.

Do you have questions?
```

### Guidance Refinement

```
I would like to work on merging each of the individual sections one at a time. To get started, let's focus on merging the guidance for authors. I do not want you to add material to the guidance, but rather only apply the following items that are relevant:

1. Maintain the emphasis on narrative and storytelling from the GPTt template while infusing it with the guidance from the Ct where there isn't a conflict between the two. When in doubt, err on the side of the GPTt template.
2. Maintain the narrative guidance and importance of the article being an immersive experience through vivid descriptions. If there is a conflict with item 1 add a section for issues so that I can review and resolve.
3. Maintain the guidance for consistency in tone, flow, and writing style. If there are duplicates, err on the side of the one with the most detail and remove others. If there is a conflict with item 1 add a section for issues so that I can review and resolve.
4. Maintain the guidance for clarity, accessibility, and engagement. If there are duplicates, err on the side of the one with the most detail and remove others. If there is a conflict with item 1 add a section for issues so that I can review and resolve.
5. Maintain the guidance for cultural sensitivity and respect. If there are duplicates, err on the side of the one with the most detail and remove others. If there is a conflict with item 1 add a section for issues so that I can review and resolve.
6. Create a new section in the template that focuses on identifying the different types of events. Include all relevant information from both templates.
7. If there are items in the guidance that are not covered in the first 6 items, provide them as a list for my review.
8. If there are items in the first 6 items that are not relevant to the existing guidelines, provide a list of them for visibility.
9. If any conflicts occurred, the resulting list should be the last one provided.

The expected outcome of these instructions is that you will provide 1 artifact with updated guidelines based on the instructions I've provided, and the 3 lists so that I may review them and provide feedback. If any of the 3 lists does not have a legitimate item it should not be displayed.

There is no part of these instructions that requires the addition of content beyond a new section with existing content. Adhere to the instructions.
```

### Merging Writing Guidelines

```
Now, let's focus on merging the writing guidelines. Given the number of them, and the overlap, I want you to dedupe the two lists. Each unique item should be retained, when there are two items that are the same I want you to:
1. Create a list when there are conflicts so that I may review them.
2. When there is no conflict maintain the one with the most detail and discard the rest.

The expected outcome of these instructions is that you will provide an merged list of guidelines where there were no conflicts, followed by a list of items that were in conflict so I may resolve them.
```

```
This is an alternate list from another source. I want you to compare this list to the updated version of guidelines we've been working on. Eliminate any of the items in this alternate list that you have already covered and provide a list of any that remain.
```

### Finalizing Guidance

```
These are the guidelines we will move forward with. They replace all prior guidelines discussed, they must be retained verbatim without alteration or addition in any way.

Compare the updated version of things authors should consider to these finalized guidelines. Share your chain of thoughts as you do so that I can understand any recommended changes to the considerations you make.
```

I provided o1-preview with a modified version of the prompt. It already possessed the guidelines and addresses OpenAI's recommendation against using explicit chain-of-thought prompts with this model, as it already performs them.

```
Compare the updated version of things authors should consider to the final guidelines. Provide any updates you would recommend making to the considerations based on this comparison.
```

```
This is an alternate list of considerations for Authors from another source. I want you to compare this list to the updated version of considerations we've been working on. Eliminate any of the items in this alternate list that you have already covered and provide a list of any that remain.
```

```
Did either of the alternate lists contain items that were not covered within our list?
```

### Updating the Article Template

```
You will use the alternative set of considerations for authors that I've supplied. Like the guidelines, they must not be altered in any way from this point on unless I explicitly state they should be updated.

Now, you will compare/contrast the two templates and provide me with the details. Afterwards, you will provide a list of recommendations on how to merge them to ensure they align with the guidance and guidelines we've locked down.
