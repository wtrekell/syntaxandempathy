<u></u>Artwork created with Midjourney v6.1### Preface

This post is part of a year-long <u>initiative where I employ AI to create content</u> about holiday traditions worldwide. The objective is to observe how various AI tools perform and improve in content creation with minimal human intervention over time. This is the 2nd of 3 articles for the month of <u>November</u>.

*Prompts and interactions with different AI models will be documented as they occur, providing insights into the methodologies, challenges, and adjustments made throughout the project*

## TL;DR

In November Pt 2, I tested how AI models perform when writing articles with varying levels of role definition. Using basic prompts, self-defined roles, and structured roles created with the Minion Maker, I generated articles about national holidays. The experiment revealed that while both Claude and GPT-4o can create roles that improve content with minimal guidance, highly structured roles consistently delivered superior results.

### AI Models

- Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- ChatGPT-4o

## Goals

- Test AI model performance with minimal guidance
- Compare basic prompts against more structured approaches
- Analyze how different AIs interpret and define their own roles

## Self-Defined Roles

Initially, I directed Claude and GPT-4o to write articles on the "Proclamation of the Republic Day" and "Dignity and Freedom Day in Ukraine," ensuring the content was engaging, ethical, and historically accurate. This approach enabled me to compare their performance and evaluate improvements when roles were clearly defined.

1. Basic Article Generation:

- I asked the AIs to write initial articles with a basic prompt.
2. Role Development:

- I had the AIs review these initial articles.
- I asked them to identify ideal skills and traits for authors of such content.
3. Role Application:

- They assumed the roles they had defined.
- When asked if they had any questions:

- Claude took a methodical approach with five focused questions.
- GPT-4o dove in with nine detailed questions, including several about SEO and deadlines.
- They wrote new articles using these self-defined characteristics.

## Structured Role Approach

Using the Minion Maker, I crafted a detailed role specifically for writing historical articles to contrast with self-defined roles based on specific parameters in my GPT.

1. I created a detailed role using the Minion Maker.
2. I asked the AIs if they had any questions before writing:

- Claude asked for clarification about the specific country and audience.
- GPT-4o proceeded directly to writing.
3. They wrote articles using this structured role.

## Prompt Specifically, Kids

It wasn't until I reached the scoring portion of the exercise that Claude highlighted I had a bit more variety than I had intended. When I tasked the AI with writing about Proclamation of the Republic Day, I neglected to specify Brazil. Since I essentially copied and pasted the prompt, the results were intriguing:

- Some focused on Brazil's 1889 proclamation.
- Others wrote about Portugal's 1910 event.
- One even decided to cover Turkey's proclamation.

## Role Definition Impact

The scoring data indicates that Minion Maker roles consistently outperform other role definitions, such as those by Claude and AI. Minion Maker articles frequently score near the top, while AI articles tend to lag behind. This trend is clear across both datasets, highlighting Minion Maker's structural advantage without significant prompting.

## Insights & Observations

### The Good

- The experiment highlights how role definition significantly impacts content quality.
- Highly structured roles consistently deliver effective results compared to less defined roles, even when augmented with factors like tone.

### The Bad

- Basic prompts lead to significant variation in topic focus.
- Balancing the specificity of different elements in prompts continues to be elusive.

### The Ugly

When you ask AI to write about Proclamation Day without specifying which one, it's like playing historical roulette‚Äîyou might end up anywhere from Brazil to Turkey, with a few surprising stops in between. It's a reminder that sometimes being too open-ended with AI is like asking a group of excited historians "tell me about a revolution" and hoping they pick the same one. üåçü§ñ

### Minion Maker Role Questions

#### Claude

Before I write the article, I have a few clarifying questions to ensure I provide the most relevant and accurate content:

1. For which country's Proclamation of the Republic Day would you like the article? Several nations celebrate such an event (e.g., Brazil, Portugal, Turkey), and each has its unique historical context and significance.
2. What is your target audience's level of familiarity with the subject? This will help me balance between providing basic context and diving into deeper historical details.
3. Would you prefer the article to focus more on:

- The events of the specific day
- The broader historical context leading up to the proclamation
- The lasting impact and modern significance
- A combination of these aspects

Once you provide these details, I can craft an article that best serves your needs while maintaining historical accuracy and engagement.
