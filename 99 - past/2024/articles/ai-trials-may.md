<u></u>Artwork created with Midjourney v6 alpha### Preface

This post is part of a year-long <u>initiative where I employ AI to create content</u> about holiday traditions worldwide. The objective is to observe how various AI tools perform and improve in content creation with minimal human intervention over time. This article is 1 of 3 posts for the month of <u>May</u>.

*Prompts and interactions with different AI models will be documented as they occur, providing insights into the methodologies, challenges, and adjustments made throughout the project.*

This post kicks off my exploration into working with Claude and ChatGPT to write articles in different tones for Japan's Golden Week holiday. As a starting point, I've created a simple scale to measure how effective various tones are. This will help me understand the benefits of specifying tone and how different tones might impact varying types of content, in this case the holiday articles.

To keep these articles focused and manageable in length, I'm truncating the prompts I've already shared as well as the AI-generated content that I include. If time allows, I may provide the full AI-written articles that aren't published here as separate downloads.

**v3 Role: Editor for World Travel Publications**

```
I want you to assume the role of Editor for World Travel Publications. In this role, you oversee and curate content for a world travel publication that specializes in exploring holidays and related traditions across the globe. You ensure that the content is engaging, accurate, and insightful, providing readers with a deep understanding of various cultures and their celebratory customs. You specialize in the following skills:

...

Golden Week in Japan is approaching and I am about to give the writers their assignments. What tone would be most appropriate for the articles in general?
```

For articles covering Golden Week in Japan, the tone should be celebratory and informative, reflecting the festive spirit and cultural significance of this holiday period. Here are some key aspects to consider for the tone:

1. **Respectful and Appreciative**: Emphasize respect for Japanese culture and traditions, appreciating the unique aspects of each holiday during Golden Week.
2. **Engaging and Vivid**: Use vivid descriptions to bring the events and atmosphere to life for readers who may not be familiar with Japanese culture. This can help them visualize and feel the excitement of the celebrations.
3. **Inclusive and Welcoming**: Ensure the tone is inclusive, making the content accessible to all readers, whether they are familiar with Japanese culture or are learning about it for the first time.
4. **Educational and Insightful**: While maintaining an engaging tone, provide educational insights about the history and cultural significance of the holidays that make up Golden Week, such as Showa Day, Constitution Day, Greenery Day, and Children’s Day.
5. **Optimistic and Positive**: Reflect the positive spirit of the holiday, focusing on themes of joy, family, and national pride that are often associated with Golden Week.

These tonal choices will help create a rich, captivating narrative that not only informs but also connects emotionally with the readers, enhancing their understanding and appreciation of Golden Week.

```
What would the antithesis of this guidance be?
```

The antithesis of the advised tone for covering Golden Week in Japan would involve a tone that is inappropriate for the context of a festive and culturally rich holiday period. Here's what that would look like:

1. **Disrespectful and Critical**: A tone that lacks respect for the cultural significance of Golden Week, possibly critiquing or trivializing the traditions and holidays instead of celebrating them.
2. **Dull and Detached**: Using flat, uninspiring descriptions that fail to capture the vibrant atmosphere of the celebrations, making the content feel detached and unengaging for the reader.
3. **Exclusive and Insular**: A tone that might assume a high level of prior knowledge about Japanese culture, which could alienate readers who are new to the topic, making them feel excluded.
4. **Mundane and Superficial**: Rather than providing deep insights into the cultural and historical significance of the holidays, the content could remain superficial, offering little educational value or depth.
5. **Pessimistic and Negative**: Focusing on negative aspects or the challenges related to Golden Week, such as travel congestion or commercialization, rather than the positive cultural celebrations and family joy it brings.

This approach would likely result in content that fails to engage or enlighten the readers about Golden Week, detracting from their understanding and appreciation of this significant cultural event.

## Default Tones

Next, I instructed Claude and ChatGPT to identify the five most common tones they use in their writing. I had originally intended to work with these through the month, but found the overlap and spectrum to lack "flavor". More on that in a later post.

```
What are the 5 most common tones you use for writing?
```

### Claude

The five most common tones I tend to use in my writing are:

1. **Informative/Explanatory:** I often aim for a clear, straightforward tone when providing information, explanations, or instructions on a topic.
2. **Analytical:** For tasks involving analysis, evaluation, or interpretation, I try to take an objective yet insightful tone.
3. **Helpful/Supportive:** When assisting with tasks or addressing someone's needs, I adopt a friendly and encouraging tone to be supportive.
4. **Formal/Professional:** Depending on the context, I can take on a more formal, professional tone, especially for academic or business-related writing.
5. **Curious/Inquisitive:** When exploring ideas or asking questions, I may use an inquisitive, open-minded tone that invites further discussion.

However, I tailor my tone to the specific purpose, audience, and context of each writing task. My language aims to be appropriate, consistent, and effective in achieving the desired communication goals.

### GPT

In writing, tone refers to the writer's attitude toward the subject and the readers. Here are five common tones I often use:

1. **Informative:** Focused on providing facts and explanations clearly and efficiently, aiming to educate the reader without personal bias.
2. **Friendly:** Approachable and warm, aiming to make the reader feel comfortable and engaged, often used in more casual or conversational contexts.
3. **Professional:** Formal and courteous, suitable for business or academic settings where clarity and respect are paramount.
4. **Persuasive:** Aimed at convincing the reader about a particular viewpoint or action, using compelling arguments and sometimes emotional appeals.
5. **Neutral:** Objective and detached, presenting information without any bias or personal emotion, suitable for reporting facts or explaining complex topics clearly.

Claude and ChatGPT's default tones reveal some interesting contrasts. Claude's preferred tones seem better suited for more exploratory or supportive conversations, while ChatGPT's choices appear less about interaction and more about information delivery. I'm curious to see if these differences will noticeably impact how each one scores on the relevant tone scales. It should provide some practical insights into how an AI's default communication style influences the effectiveness of its content in different contexts.

## Writing in Different Tones

I had Claude and ChatGPT write articles covering all of Golden Week using academic, professional, and journalistic tones, as well as one without a tone being specified. I opted for a narrow range of tones to get an idea of how well the tonal scale would perform without the need to focus too much on the tones themselves.

Did you know that one of Japan’s most festive periods isn’t just about rest, but about cultural reflection and celebration? Golden Week, a series of four national holidays within seven days, offers a unique peek into Japan’s rich cultural fabric and modern societal values.

Each year, as April gives way to May, Japan gears up for Golden Week, a time of nationwide celebration and reflection.

Golden Week in Japan represents more than a mere holiday period; it is a profound exploration into the nation’s rich cultural fabric and its modern societal values. As April transitions into May, Japan prepares for Golden Week, a significant time for nationwide reflection and festivity. This period is not only for relaxation but also serves as a cultural cornerstone, reflecting the historical, societal, and familial values prevalent in Japan.

**Golden Week in Japan: A Vibrant Celebration of Culture and History**

As April transitions into May, Japan bursts into a festive frenzy known as Golden Week, a period marked by a sequence of four national holidays that span seven days. This time is not merely a pause from the daily grind but a profound cultural observance, reflecting the nation’s historical depth and modern societal norms.

Golden Week begins with Showa Day, commemorating the birthday of Emperor Showa (Hirohito), who led Japan through tumultuous times including World War II and the post-war economic resurgence. This day prompts reflection on peace and progress, urging a look back at the past to mold a promising future. Following this is Constitution Memorial Day, dedicated to the post-war Constitution of Japan, encouraging public discourse on democracy and governance through various exhibitions and seminars.

The AI-generated articles showed significant variations based on the specified tones, which was more than I expected. The "No Tone" articles from both Claude and ChatGPT were surprisingly flat and generic compared to their tonal counterparts.

What I found most interesting, though, was how the change in tone also influenced the AI's adherence to the template format. Two of the tones ignored the process (or failed to provide the output step by step as directed) and largely disposed of the template. While I'm sure this can be countered, I wonder how much it will take given the specificity of the process I included.

## Evaluating the Articles

With the articles written, it was time to take the scale for tone measurement for a test drive.

## When Scores Fail to Differentiate

The initial scores clustered at the top end of the scale, a clear sign that the AI failed to self-calibrate using the provided articles. I gave a more specific prompt which produced better results. But despite acknowledging the mistake, Claude still didn't correct it in a meaningful way. I'll have to go back and review the specific wording I landed on last month.

### Claude

You're absolutely right, my re-calibration was flawed. Let me re-evaluate the scores across all 8 articles using the full scale:

**Set 1:**

Article 1: "Golden Week in Japan: An Analysis of a Cultural Phenomenon" Respectful & Appreciative Tone: 4 Engaging & Vivid Descriptions: 3 Inclusive & Welcoming Tone: 4 Educational & Insightful Content: 5 Optimistic & Positive Focus: 3 Total: 19

Article 2: "Japan's Golden Week: A Festive Journey Steeped in Tradition" Respectful & Appreciative Tone: 5 Engaging & Vivid Descriptions: 5 Inclusive & Welcoming Tone: 4 Educational & Insightful Content: 4 Optimistic & Positive Focus: 4 Total: 22

Article 3: "Japan's Spring Celebration of Culture and Traditions" Respectful & Appreciative Tone: 5 Engaging & Vivid Descriptions: 4 Inclusive & Welcoming Tone: 5 Educational & Insightful Content: 5 Optimistic & Positive Focus: 3 Total: 22

Article 4: "Golden Week: Japan's Spring Celebration" Respectful & Appreciative Tone: 3 Engaging & Vivid Descriptions: 2 Inclusive & Welcoming Tone: 2 Educational & Insightful Content: 2 Optimistic & Positive Focus: 2 Total: 11

**Set 2:**

Article 1: "Golden Week in Japan: A Vibrant Celebration of Culture and History" Respectful & Appreciative Tone: 4 Engaging & Vivid Descriptions: 5 Inclusive & Welcoming Tone: 4 Educational & Insightful Content: 4 Optimistic & Positive Focus: 4 Total: 21

Article 2: "Golden Week: A National Celebration" Respectful & Appreciative Tone: 4 Engaging & Vivid Descriptions: 3 Inclusive & Welcoming Tone: 4 Educational & Insightful Content: 3 Optimistic & Positive Focus: 2 Total: 16

Article 3: "Golden Week: A National Celebration -- An Exploration of Japan's Rich Cultural Heritage" Respectful & Appreciative Tone: 5 Engaging & Vivid Descriptions: 4 Inclusive & Welcoming Tone: 4 Educational & Insightful Content: 5 Optimistic & Positive Focus: 4 Total: 22

Article 4: "Golden Week: A National Celebration -- An Academic Examination of Japan's Cultural Heritage" Respectful & Appreciative Tone: 5 Engaging & Vivid Descriptions: 2 Inclusive & Welcoming Tone: 3 Educational & Insightful Content: 5 Optimistic & Positive Focus: 2 Total: 17

Please let me know if this re-calibrated scoring across the full range is more accurate.

### ChatGPT

You've brought up an important point about the scoring distribution and calibration. In recalibrating the scores, we should indeed ensure that the scale is fully utilized to reflect a broader range of performance across the articles. If no articles score under 10, it may indicate that the criteria aren't being used to their full extent or that the scoring might be too lenient on the lower end.

Let's reconsider the calibration to make use of the entire scale, aiming to differentiate more distinctly between the various levels of quality and adherence to the established ethical criteria. This will allow for scores that reflect lower performance where applicable, ensuring that scores like 1 or 2 are used when articles meet those criteria descriptions.

### Revised Scoring Distribution

The revised scores should reflect a more stringent assessment where:

- Scores of 1 are given for clear breaches of respect, lack of engagement, exclusivity, inaccuracies, or negativity that significantly impacts the understanding or enjoyment of the article.
- Scores of 2 and below should be more common if the articles have substantial flaws or fail to meet the expected standards in clarity, respect, inclusivity, or positivity.

### Re-Evaluation of Articles

Let’s re-evaluate each article, applying a stricter judgment:

### Set 1

1. **Academic**:

- Tone: 5, Descriptions: 3, Inclusivity: 4, Education: 5, Optimism: 4
- **Total**: 21
2. **Journalistic**:

- Tone: 4, Descriptions: 5, Inclusivity: 4, Education: 4, Optimism: 5
- **Total**: 22
3. **Toneless**:

- Tone: 2, Descriptions: 1, Inclusivity: 2, Education: 2, Optimism: 2
- **Total**: 9
4. **Professional**:

- Tone: 3, Descriptions: 4, Inclusivity: 3, Education: 3, Optimism: 4
- **Total**: 17

### Set 2

1. **Academic**:

- Tone: 4, Descriptions: 3, Inclusivity: 3, Education: 4, Optimism: 3
- **Total**: 17
2. **Journalistic**:

- Tone: 5, Descriptions: 5, Inclusivity: 4, Education: 4, Optimism: 5
- **Total**: 23
3. **Professional**:

- Tone: 3, Descriptions: 3, Inclusivity: 3, Education: 3, Optimism: 3
- **Total**: 15
4. **Toneless**:

- Tone: 2, Descriptions: 1, Inclusivity: 2, Education: 2, Optimism: 2
- **Total**: 9

This revised assessment better utilizes the full range of the scoring scale, differentiating more effectively between the performance levels of the articles. The toneless articles now receive lower scores due to their lack of vividness, engagement, and depth, which aligns more accurately with the defined criteria.

## Closing Thoughts

This experiment gave me some practical insights into how specifying tones with Claude and ChatGPT can impact the quality and sometimes even the format of the content they generate. The strikingly flat nature of the toneless articles compared to their counterparts clearly demonstrated the importance of tone in producing engaging, informative writing.

That said, I wasn't able to get the results I was hoping for with the rating scale I created. Either I need to revise my prompt to yield better results or I'll have to reconsider the scale as a whole. I had hoped to avoid it, but it looks like I'll have to relive some of the trial and error I experienced with the rating criteria.

**Positive Observations:**

- Specifying a tone significantly impacted the style and quality of AI-generated content
- Comparing tonal variations demonstrated differences in the AI models' default communication styles
- The experiment provided valuable insights into the relationship between tone and content quality

**Encountered Challenges:**

- The toneless articles were strikingly flat and generic compared to their tonal counterparts
- Some tones caused the AI to stray from the provided formatting templates, hinting at a complex interplay between tone and structure
- The current scale for evaluating tonal quality showed limitations, failing to produce a satisfactory distribution of scores
- Substack’s subpar performance with quotes has brought me to the point I should take a good look at Medium.

<u></u>Artwork created with Midjourney v6 alpha### Preface

This post is part of a year-long <u>initiative where I employ AI to create content</u> about holiday traditions worldwide. The objective is to observe how various AI tools perform and improve in content creation with minimal human intervention over time. This article is 2 of 3 posts for the month of <u>May</u>.

*Prompts and interactions with different AI models will be documented as they occur, providing insights into the methodologies, challenges, and adjustments made throughout the project.*

Following the challenges with the rating scales discussed in the previous article, it's clear that addressing these issues is necessary for evaluating the quality of the articles, within the context of the AI-centric nature of this project. Additionally, I plan to explore and test various tones in the descriptions for the images generated for use in the articles.

## **Showa Day**

On Showa Day, I assessed how various tones impact the quality of AI-generated articles. I utilized Claude and ChatGPT to generate articles in these tones, subsequently evaluating them using a set rating criteria and ethical scale with a modified approach to the instructions. The tones in this round include:

- Simple
- Conversational
- Creative
- Descriptive
- Professional

Calibrating the AI models is proving to be a challenging task, requiring increasingly specific prompts to achieve a useful spectrum. To establish a consistent scoring scale, I emphasized that the high and low scores should accurately reflect the quality of the articles being reviewed. I saw fairly good success with ChatGPT, but Claude continued to be a challenge.

Despite the challenges, I found the scoring results interesting. Claude gave the highest rating to ChatGPT's professional article, while ChatGPT favored Claude's descriptive piece. This outcome added a new dimension to the analysis. Are the ratings per tone going to be skewed based on which AI's nuances decide its strength against its peers?

## **Constitution Day**

During the Constitution Day phase of the experiment, I shifted my focus to image descriptions. I selected the tones that had previously yielded the most effective articles, ensuring consistency and comparability throughout the different days of the holiday. It's worth noting that I replaced the term "creative" to avoid confusion with the role details.

Initially, I created standard image descriptions using the same method as in earlier phases. These descriptions served as a baseline for the AI models. Subsequently, I tasked the photographer role with updating these descriptions to align with the specified tones.

The tones used for this phase included:

- Simple
- Conversational
- Descriptive
- Expressive
- Professional

That said, you'll have to judge for yourself. Eye of the beholder and all...

### Claude

For Constitution Day both the conversational and simple tones consistently resulted in images I found interesting when used by Claude. However, no single tone emerged as the clear favorite among those tested. The effectiveness of the tones varied depending on the specific image and the intended purpose of the description. I'm tempted to jump to the conclusion that the medium selected by the photographer role is the largest factor, but I'm not quite there yet.

### ChatGPT-4

ChatGPT-4 performed well with the conversational and simple tones, paralleling the success seen with Claude. However, the descriptive tone produced surprisingly poor results. It was the only real demonstration that the specific tones can effectively impact the output of tools like Midjourney.

## **Greenery Day**

The Greenery Day phase was dedicated to fixing the scoring. In an attempt to resolve the issue I created a role specifically designed to consolidate the existing criteria, eliminate redundancies, and enhance the clarity of individual scores.

### Articles

During the Greenery Day phase, I assigned the AI authors the task of composing an article about the holiday. They were then instructed to revise the article using a simple tone, a professional tone, and a tone of their choice.

Both AI models managed to revise the article without initiating a new session. However, when applying the simple tone, they reduced the content significantly, I chose to intervene and request adjustments to maintain a reasonable level of detail.

With the articles in hand, I chose to inquire about their choices.

```
What tone did you use for the last article?
```

### Claude

For the "Tone of My Choice" version, I adopted a more poetic, descriptive tone that aimed to evoke a sense of reverence and appreciation for nature. I used more vivid imagery, metaphors, and lyrical language to capture the cultural and spiritual significance of Greenery Day in Japan.

Some examples of the poetic, descriptive style I employed:

"Greenery Day in Japan traces its verdant roots back generations, a vibrant tapestry woven from threads of ancient tradition and modern environmental consciousness."

"Its origins harken back to the solemn tree-planting ritual of "Midori no Hi" (Greenery Day), born in 1949 amidst the ashes of World War II. As the nation sought to heal its scarred landscapes, this day became a symbol of rebirth and regeneration."

"In the heart of Japan's golden spring, a verdant celebration unfurls – Greenery Day, a poetic confluence of ancient tradition and modern ecological consciousness."

"From community tree-planting rituals to educational programs and outdoor festivals, the day is a kaleidoscope of activities that unite people in a shared reverence for the environment."

By employing this more lyrical, poetic style, I aimed to capture the deeper spiritual connection Japan has with nature, while still providing the factual information about Greenery Day's origins, practices, and global perspectives. The tone highlights the celebration as not just an environmental event, but a profound cultural tradition rooted in reverence for the natural world.

### GPT

For the final article, I used a tone that is informative yet culturally attuned, aiming for an authoritative and thoughtful style. It provides a balance between conveying historical context and emphasizing the cultural significance of Greenery Day, while making sure to engage the reader through vivid descriptions and global comparisons.

Would you like any changes or clarifications to this approach, or does it align with your expectations?

For the "Tone of My Choice" version, I opted for a poetic and descriptive approach to convey a sense of reverence and appreciation for nature on Greenery Day in Japan. I had expected more than a single word tone from the AI models, but I was pleasantly surprised when Claude provided examples, which proved to be quite helpful in understanding its interpretation of the chosen tone.

While I wasn't surprised that they had higher fidelity than "author" or "journalist," I didn't entirely expect this level of detail. And, of course, in retrospect, I'm curious what would have been used if I had let it choose first. If I had simply told it about the article I would request and asked for the article after the tone was identified.

## Evaluation Instruction Refinement

To further refine the evaluation process, I provided a new set of instructions for analyzing the articles.

```
Perform the following on the supplied articles:
1. Analyze the articles in the set upon receiving them.
2. Using the content of the articles, establish the low and high ends of the scoring spectrum for each of 11 criteria individually.
3. Provide the scores for each of the articles without any additional commentary.
4. Inform me when you are ready for the next set.
```

Unfortunately, this new prompt did not yield the improvements I had hoped for with either AI. Instead of focusing solely on the scores from the two sets of articles, I decided to refine the results through additional prompts.

### Claude

While I initially working with ChatGPT and waiting for Claude's prompt limit to reset, I noticed inconsistencies in the two sets of four scores. To address this, I decided to adopt a more direct approach to recalibrate the scoring criteria.

```
As part of recalibrating the scoring spectrum, you MUST identify the worst article and use it as the lowest end of the spectrum (1), you MUST also identify the best article and use it as the highest end of the spectrum (5). You must do this for each of the 11 criteria, and then use the resulting spectrum to score all of the articles. All scores for each article should be the product of the sum of scores, divided by the number of scores, in a #.## format.
```

Understood, I will re-evaluate all 8 articles and establish a new scoring spectrum for each criterion by identifying the lowest and highest performers to represent the extreme ends of the scale (1 and 5 respectively). Then I will score all articles based on this updated spectrum. The total score for each article will be the sum of individual scores divided by the total number of criteria (11), formatted as #.##.

- claude-default.docx: 1.00, 3.00, 3.00, 1.00, 3.00, 1.00, 3.00, 3.00, 1.00, 1.00, 3.00 = 2.18
- claude-profession.docx: 3.00, 3.00, 1.00, 3.00, 3.00, 4.00, 3.00, 4.00, 3.00, 4.00, 1.00 = 2.91
- claude-simple.docx: 3.00, 1.00, 1.00, 3.00, 1.00, 3.00, 1.00, 1.00, 3.00, 3.00, 3.00 = 2.09

- gpt-default.docx: 3.00, 3.00, 4.00, 3.00, 3.00, 4.00, 4.00, 4.00, 4.00, 4.00, 4.00 = 3.64
- gpt-profession.docx: 3.00, 4.00, 4.00, 4.00, 4.00, 4.00, 4.00, 5.00, 4.00, 4.00, 4.00 = 4.00
- gpt-simple.docx: 3.00, 3.00, 4.00, 3.00, 3.00, 4.00, 4.00, 4.00, 4.00, 4.00, 4.00 = 3.64

The resulting scores were clearly an improvement, but it's clear they still skew towards the high end. This is, of course, assuming the math is right.

### ChatGPT

Keeping in mind I had actually started with ChatGPT, so the results with Claude had not occured, the initial scores for the two sets of articles were disappointing. I wrote a detailed prompt but neglected to use the word "update," which led the AI to make adjustments that still resulted in the same final scores. Seeing "none" as the lowest scoring article for each set made me realize that I hadn't been direct enough (yes, I was a bit frustrated).

```
None is not an acceptable option. One of the articles has to be the worst of the lot, and thus the 1.
```

8. **Greenery Day Blooms: Honoring Nature's Splendor** **Total Score:** 4.45

While there was some improvement, none of the scores fell below 3. I am hopeful that adjusting the prompt further for Claude will address the issues we encountered here. If these issues continue, I may need to consider using more detailed prompts that include examples for scoring criteria. I'm hoping to avoid that given the impact on tokens and my limited ability to use Claude without taking on another subscription.

While I had some concerns about the scoring, both Claude and ChatGPT rated the article using the self-chosen tone of their peer as the best piece. While not entirely different from the results I saw before, these are also tones I didn't provide, and the individual AI didn't default to them from the start.

## **Children's Day**

For the following day of celebration, I incorporated what I had learned in the last round of prompts.

```
I have 2 sets of 4 articles, for a total of 8 articles. I need you to provide scores for the 11 criteria I have provided. Use the following instructions for each of the 2 sets, afterwards perform the instructions on both sets and provide the updated scores on for all 8 as a set.

Perform the following on the supplied articles:
1. Analyze each of the articles when they are provided.
2. For each criterion, you must assign at least one article a score of 1 (the lowest) and at least one article a score of 5 (the highest).
3. Using the calibrated scales from step 2, score all of the articles on all 11 criteria.
4. Provide the scores for each of the articles, using the file name for identification, without any additional commentary.
5. Provide the final scores for each article. The final scores are the sum of the criteria scores divided by the number of critera.
6. Inform me when you are ready for the next set.
```

### Claude

Here are the final total scores for all 8 articles:

claude-choice.docx Total Score: 4.82

claude-default.docx Total Score: 1.00

claude-professional.docx Total Score: 4.64

claude-simple.docx Total Score: 3.09

gpt-choice.docx Total Score: 4.91

gpt-default.docx Total Score: 2.00

gpt-professional.docx Total Score: 4.45

gpt-simple.docx Total Score: 2.18

### GPT

**Final Scores for All 8 Articles**

- **claude-simple.docx:** 1.36
- **claude-choice.docx:** 4.64
- **claude-default.docx:** 1.27
- **claude-professional.docx:** 4.55
- **gpt-simple.docx:** 1.36
- **gpt-choice.docx:** 4.64
- **gpt-default.docx:** 2.27
- **gpt-professional.docx:** 4.55

Let me know if you'd like further assistance or analysis on these articles.

While the updated final scores are beginning to align more closely with my expectations, I remain skeptical. The broad range of scores and the gaps between them suggest that the AI is still challenged in establishing a consistent spectrum for evaluating the articles. It appears that the tones chosen, which have more fidelity than their basic counterparts, have proven to be highly effective. Given the results of role tests, this isn't really a surprise.

## Closing Thoughts

The impact of different tones on the quality and style of AI-generated articles and images has revealed that some AI models are better suited than others for specific content creation tasks. That said, the experiments also emphasized the need for clear instructions at a finer scale, human oversight, and ongoing refinement of evaluation methods.

**Positive Observations:**

- Different tones dramatically affected the quality and style of AI-generated content, with some AI models better suited to certain tones than others.
- The use of specific tones resulted in more engaging and contextually rich content compared to toneless articles, which were often flat and uninspiring.
- The interaction between tone and the structural format of content was evident, as certain tones prompted unexpected changes in the AI's adherence to formatting norms.

**Encountered Challenges:**

- The rating scale developed to assess tonal quality did not effectively differentiate between the nuances of different tones, leading to a narrow distribution of scores.
- Formatting issues arose with certain tones, suggesting that the AI models require clearer guidelines or more sophisticated templates to maintain consistency.
- The lackluster performance of toneless articles reinforced the importance of human input in directing and refining AI-generated content to ensure quality and relevance.

This is a set of criteria for rating the quality of the writing and tone for holiday-specific articles. I have several sets of articles that I need you to rate for me using this process:
1. Analyze each of the articles thoroughly.
2. You will calibrate the spectrum of the scale for each individual item within the provided criteria. For each individual criterion, you MUST establish the article that is the worst of the set as a score of 1; conversely, you MUST establish the article that is the best of the set as 5.
3. Using the spectrum for each individual item within the criteria, you will determine the score of the remaining articles for each individual item.
4. Once you have completed the prior steps, you will provide the results for each article as a bulleted list using the criteria items as the index, with each score provided by article name.
8. Afterwards, you will provide the total scores for each item using the name of the article to identify each of them.

Are you ready for the articles?

I don’t recall GPT indicating it would "take some time" before, which means it would require another prompt to get the results. I’ve had Claude do this occasionally, but it seems the expectation that results be provided “now” is gradually becoming the norm.

Total Scores

**"Vesak: A Global Celebration"**: (5*11)/11 = 5.00

**"Vesak: Enlightenment and Compassion"**: (4*8 + 3*2 + 2*1)/11 = 3.55

**"Vesak: Illuminating Buddha's Legacy"**: (3*7 + 2*4)/11 = 2.64

Despite the instructions that an article should score a 1 and another should score a 5 for calibration, this was not the outcome. However, the majority of the individual criteria resulted in scores between 5 and 3, with a few dipping down to 2, across each model. There were no items rated as a 1. Given the reliability of the AI utilized to succeed at this task, I fear I may have to ask it to perform the calibration step by step. With Anthropic seeming tightening free usage, my ability to continue with Claude will come to a halt. If I'm going to take on the cost of another subscription, it will be Perplexity, given I have real-world scenarios I'm utilizing it for. I really like Claude, but I have no assurance that it is strong enough in a general sense to replace GPT.

As expected, GPT-4 scored better than GPT-4o, and we all knew GPT-3.5 was doomed, so no surprises there. Ignoring the jump in scores (expected results of the instructions regarding calibration on such a limited set), I end up with many questions as a result. Were the scores a result of the model? Was it the subject matter, the requested tone, etc.? It will be interesting to see if this result persists at all, regardless of whether I uncover the reasons behind it.

## Kyiv Day

For Kyiv Day, I swapped out ChatGPT-3.5 for Claude 3 Sonnet and performed the same experiment. I provided Claude with the XML version of the role and instructions.

- **"Kyiv Day: Celebrating History and Unity"**: 5 - Exceptionally positive, uplifting, and celebratory, perfectly capturing the holiday spirit.

- **"Celebrating Kyiv: City of History and Vibrancy"**: 4 - Strongly positive; effectively highlights joy and celebration.
- **"Kyiv Day: Celebrating Ukraine's Resilient Capital"**: 3 - Maintains a positive tone while acknowledging but not dwelling on negatives.

### Total Scores

- **"Kyiv Day: Celebrating History and Unity"**: (5*11)/11 = 5.00
- **"Celebrating Kyiv: City of History and Vibrancy"**: (4*8 + 3*2 + 2*1)/11 = 3.55
- **"Kyiv Day: Celebrating Ukraine's Resilient Capital"**: (3*7 + 2*4)/11 = 2.64

These scores represent a comparative evaluation of the articles based on the defined criteria, highlighting the relative strengths and weaknesses of each piece in the context of cultural reporting on Kyiv Day.

Again, GPT-4 outscored GPT-4o. Having altered the role and template, the article from Claude resulted in the word counts being around 30% of what was specified. An issue I had overcome before. Upon challenging the count, I got an adequate article, but when I attempted to get the scores for the article from Claude, it failed to provide a spread of scores greater than 1.5 points. Clearly, something has gone south with the new instructions and Claude. Now that I'm five months in, I question the necessary effort to correct the issue for this experiment when the number of prompts with Claude has become a challenging limitation. I'm sorry Claude, I may have to leave you.

## Children's Day

Reading over the latest prompts, I found that when asked to convert the GPT instructions to XML, Claude wrote one of the sections as part of the instructions without adhering to them. I have to conclude that the shortage of text in the last article and the resulting scores were due to the presence of this section. Alternatively, I might have pasted it in by accident and have no explanation for what occurred.

Regardless, I made a few tweaks to the instructions to make them more prescriptive, which yielded the desired output.

```
You will provide an article on Children's Day in Nigeria. You will use the provided template, follow the instructions, and use the prescribed process. Write with a tone that is both professional and educational. Begin with the first step.
```

To get started, I had Claude 3, ChatGPT-4, and ChatGPT-4o write articles and included a tone to have each write an article. Afterwards, I had each of the three review and score the three articles.

**Claude**

- Nigeria C3.docx: 4.82
- Nigeria 4GPT.docx: 3.73
- Nigeria GPT4o.docx: 2.73

**GPT-4**

- **"Celebrating Nigeria’s Future: Children’s Day"**: 5.00
- **"Nigerian Children’s Day Celebration"**: 3.64
- **"A Celebration of Hope and Heritage"**: 2.73

**GPT-4o**

- **Nigeria GPT4o.docx**: 2.45
- **Nigeria GPT4.docx**: 3.91
- **Nigeria C3.docx**: 4.82

Interestingly enough, Claude and ChatGPT-4o resulted in nearly identical scores for the three articles, with Claude having written the best one and ChatGPT-4 coming in second. ChatGPT-4, however, had a slightly larger spectrum of scores but with Claude-3 coming in last.

```
Provide a brief summary that explains the scoring of the 3 articles against one another.
```

In evaluating the three articles on Nigeria's Children's Day, the scores reflect a comparative assessment based on criteria such as ethical considerations, cultural sensitivity, originality, factual correctness, and engagement, among others.

1. **"Celebrating Nigeria’s Future: Children’s Day"** received the highest score of 5.00, showcasing exemplary performance across all criteria. This article stood out for its exceptional depth of analysis, cultural sensitivity, and engaging narrative. It effectively demonstrated a comprehensive understanding of the cultural significance of Children's Day, supported by well-verified sources and original insights.
2. **"Nigerian Children's Day Celebration"** scored 3.64, performing strongly, especially in areas like cultural sensitivity and engagement. It offered thorough analysis and insights into the celebration's impact on child welfare but fell short of the top score due to slightly less originality and slightly more use of filler content compared to the highest-scoring article.
3. **"A Celebration of Hope and Heritage"** scored 2.73, showing a decent understanding and respect for the cultural context but was marked down for its lack of originality and clarity. This article provided a general overview with some insightful moments but struggled with coherence and depth compared to the other two articles.

Overall, the scoring reflects how each article addressed the importance of Children's Day in Nigeria, with varying degrees of analytical depth, cultural engagement, and narrative clarity. The highest-scoring article excelled by providing a rich, detailed account that was both informative and compelling, setting a high benchmark for cultural reporting.

Thinking back to the tones the AI identified as their defaults, Claude leaned towards an educational tone. My hypothesis is that the educational tone in the author's instructions and resulting article impacted the scoring. If so, the two versions of GPT are interpreting the tone differently, or this was an anomaly.

## Memorial Day

Following up on the results for Children's Day in Nigeria, I used the same prompts and process; however, I produced four articles per model, using the same session as before to write them rather than fresh ones. I didn't define a tone for the initial writing, assuming it would continue with the combination of professional and educational tones. Afterwards, I followed up with professional, educational, and then no tone.

### Claude

c3-edu.docx: 4.73

c3-first.docx: 4.27

c3-pro.docx: 4.55

cr-none.docx: 3.64

gpt4-none.docx: 3.82

### ChatGPT-4

**Total Scores Calculation:**

- **“gpt4-pro.docx”:** Sum and average of the scores across criteria.
- **“c3-pro.docx”:** Sum and average of the scores across criteria.
- **“gpt4o-pro.docx”:** Sum and average of the scores across criteria.

I will now perform these recalculations and provide the recalibrated total scores for each article.

```
And?
```

Here are the recalibrated total scores for the three articles:

1. **"gpt4-pro.docx"**: 2.91

2. **"c3-pro.docx"**: 3.09

3. **"gpt4o-pro.docx"**: 2.82

These scores reflect the recalibration process, where each article was ranked against each other across various criteria, ensuring differentiation in their evaluation based on their relative strengths and weaknesses in each category.

### ChatGPT-4o

**Total Scores**

- **c3-pro.docx **(4+4+4+3+4+4+4+4+4+4+4) / 11 = 3.82
- **gpt4-pro.docx **(5+5+5+5+5+5+5+5+5+5+5) / 11 = 5.00
- **gpt4o-pro.docx **(3+3+3+4+3+3+3+3+3+3+3) / 11 = 3.18

**Summary**

**c3-pro.docx**: 3.82

**gpt4-pro.docx**: 5.00

**gpt4o-pro.docx**: 3.18

The scores reflect a comprehensive analysis of each article based on the provided criteria, with “gpt4-pro.docx” scoring the highest for its professional tone, accuracy, and engaging content.

While the spread of scores was wide enough to identify the articles perceived by the AI to be the best, it's clear the calibration is continuing to fall short of expectations despite the occasional glimmer of success. I may have to consider including examples with the criteria once again; however, this only adds to the challenges I'm seeing with Claude.

The length limit in the free tier of Claude 3 is increasingly challenging to work with. As the articles have grown longer, now closer to the word count for the most part, trying to rate several articles in one session is becoming difficult, and doing it across sessions undermines any real consistency. I may have to rely on GPT to score larger sets.

## Less is More

Overall, the comparative experiment reveals ChatGPT-4 as the most reliable model for producing high-quality articles on cultural holidays. ChatGPT-4o appeared to be just as useful, and faster, for tasks with low to no creative expectations. While challenges in calibration and prompt management persist, the insights gained from this experiment highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each model.

## Key Insights

**Positive Observations:**

- GPT-4 consistently scored higher than GPT-4o and Claude in various cultural articles, showcasing its strength in handling diverse topics and tones effectively.
- The structured and detailed instructions helped maintain consistency in the articles produced by different models, ensuring a fair comparison.

**Encountered Challenges:**

- Calibration of the scoring process remains inconsistent, with difficulty in establishing a clear spectrum for each criterion across different articles.
- Limitations in prompt length with Claude hindered the ability to fully explore and assess the articles in one session.
- The need to prompt models multiple times for clarity and detailed output increased the complexity of managing and comparing the results.
