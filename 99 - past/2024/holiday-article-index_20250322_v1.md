## AI Trials: July Pt 1
In [July Pt 1](https://open.substack.com/pub/quietdevolution/p/ai-trials-july-pt-1?r=2c384i&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_showWelcomeOnShare=true), I began winding down role tests with a final push to validate recent findings after AI model updates. I compared a newer version of the role creation GPT with its predecessor, finding no significant improvements. Additionally, I experimented with JSON as an alternative to Markdown, which produced mixed results. These trials continued to refine our understanding of AI-assisted content creation techniques.
## AI Trials: July Pt 2
In [July Pt 2](https://open.substack.com/pub/quietdevolution/p/ai-trials-july-pt-2?r=2c384i&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_showWelcomeOnShare=true), I tested AI roles across five holidays. Despite past improvements, results were underwhelming, with GPT-4 showing inconsistency and Claude performing better with JSON. Analysis of 60 score sets revealed diminishing returns in the current role-creation method. The project also explored data visualization, with GPT-4 experiencing issues on less common chart types.

## November
In November, I explored how different prompt structures affect AI content generation. Starting with basic prompts and progressing to more sophisticated approaches, I tested how varying levels of complexity impacted article quality. The experiments demonstrated the value of structured prompts while revealing scoring inconsistencies between AI models. This led to insights about prompt design and the importance of balancing complexity with practical effectiveness.

### AI Trials: November Pt 1
In [November Pt 1](https://open.substack.com/pub/quietdevolution/p/ai-trials-november-pt-1?r=2c384i&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_showWelcomeOnShare=true), I examined how the complexity of prompts – ranging from simple requests to detailed templates – impacts the quality of AI-generated content. The evaluation scores suggested that the rubric and template structure might be affecting the results in unexpected ways, though both AI models ultimately agreed on the general root cause.
### AI Trials: November Pt 2
In [November Pt 2](https://open.substack.com/pub/quietdevolution/p/ai-trials-november-pt-2?r=2c384i&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_showWelcomeOnShare=true), I explored how different levels of role definition influence the quality of content produced by Claude and GPT-4o. By comparing basic prompts, self-defined roles, and fully structured roles, the study demonstrated that a more structured approach consistently led to superior content quality.
### AI Trials: November Pt 3
In [November Pt 3](https://open.substack.com/pub/quietdevolution/p/ai-trials-november-pt-3?r=2c384i&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_showWelcomeOnShare=true), I investigated the evolution of AI scoring systems and evaluation methods by analyzing articles about Andrés Bonifacio. I found that Claude tended to adjust scores upward consistently, whereas GPT-4o made broader downward revisions with occasional insignificant increases. Notably, one-shot prompt articles performed erratically, underscoring the need for iterative feedback and refinement in evaluation methods.
