<u></u>Artwork. created with Midjourney v5.2### Preface

This post is part of a year-long <u>initiative where I employ AI to create content</u> about holiday traditions worldwide. The objective is to observe how various AI tools perform and improve in content creation with minimal human intervention over time. This article is 2 of 8 posts for the month of <u>February</u>.

*Prompts and interactions with different AI models will be documented as they occur, providing insights into the methodologies, challenges, and adjustments made throughout the project.*

As I discussed in my <u>February Pt 1</u>, I've created specialized AI roles to use this across varying activities this month. This second role will be used to critique and rate the articles being written by the author roles on the same, and other platforms.

This post, in itself, does not cover an experiment in itself, it does however document the process used to evolve the templates as well as enhance the rating system.

```

Your proposed framework for assessing the quality of articles provides a comprehensive approach, covering essential aspects of content quality that range from factual accuracy to originality. This structure is well-suited to evaluate a wide spectrum of articles, accommodating both novice and professional contributions. Here are several critiques and suggestions to refine and potentially enhance the framework:

**1. Accuracy and Factual Correctness**

- **Feedback Mechanism:** Consider adding a mechanism for feedback on factual inaccuracies, allowing authors to correct and update content. This encourages ongoing accuracy and learning.
- **Source Transparency:** Encourage explicit mention or easy access to sources within the article to validate accuracy and encourage reader verification.

**2. Depth of Historical Context**

- **Balance with Relevance:** Ensure that the depth of historical context is balanced with relevance to the article's main focus. Overemphasis on context could overshadow the core message for less specialized readers.

**3. Ratio of Informational Content vs Filler Words**

- **Subjectivity in Assessment:** Define more clearly what constitutes "filler words" versus "necessary elaboration" to reduce subjectivity in this assessment. Providing examples could help raters make consistent judgments.

**4. Clarity and Coherence**

- **Inclusivity of Language Complexity:** Recognize that the use of specialized language may be necessary for certain topics. Provide guidelines for when and how to appropriately use jargon, including explanations for lay readers.

**Overall Rating**

- **Consistency in Evaluation:** Provide guidelines or training for raters to ensure consistency in how the overall rating is determined, addressing potential bias or variability in interpretation of the criteria.

**Implementation Suggestions:**

- **Rating Scale Flexibility:** Consider introducing a mechanism for raters to indicate when they feel unable to judge a criterion due to lack of expertise, potentially skewing the overall assessment.
- **Feedback for Improvement:** Alongside ratings, require specific, actionable feedback that writers can use to improve their work, focusing on development rather than solely evaluation.
- **Benchmark Examples:** Offer benchmark articles exemplifying each rating level across the criteria to serve as concrete standards for comparison and to help normalize ratings across different raters.

Implementing these suggestions could enhance the clarity, fairness, and developmental value of the framework, making it a more effective tool for guiding content creators towards excellence while accommodating a wide range of expertise levels.

```
Remove recommendation 1, 4, 5, and the first two implementation suggestions. Provide detailed guidance on how to update, or add to, the criteria that reflects there are no examples to be provided, it would skew the purpose of this exercise.
```

To refine the framework while aligning with your request to exclude certain recommendations and without providing examples, here are updated or added criteria for the remaining dimensions, ensuring clarity and enhancing the framework's effectiveness without relying on examples:

**2. Depth of Historical Context**

- **Expanded Criteria:**

- Incorporate a criterion that assesses the integration of historical context with the main narrative, ensuring it enhances rather than overshadows the key message.
- Add a guideline for evaluating the relevance of included historical context to the article's focus, ensuring that every historical detail contributes meaningfully to the reader's understanding.

**3. Ratio of Informational Content vs Filler Words**

- **Clarified Criteria:**

- Define informational content as facts, insights, analyses, or narratives that directly contribute to the article's objectives, enhancing the reader's understanding or engagement with the topic.
- Specify filler words as phrases or sentences that do not add value to the article's main purpose, including repetitive statements, unnecessary elaborations, or off-topic digressions.

**6. Critical Analysis and Interpretation**

- **Enhanced Criteria:**

- Emphasize the importance of presenting a well-rounded analysis by considering various interpretations and implications of historical events, ensuring a multifaceted approach to understanding.
- Include the ability to contextualize historical events within contemporary issues or debates, highlighting the relevance of historical analysis to current societal understanding.

**7. Originality and Uniqueness**

- **Refined Criteria:**

- Stress the significance of approaching well-covered topics from a fresh angle or uncovering lesser-known aspects of a subject, thereby contributing new insights to the discourse.
- Encourage the exploration of interdisciplinary connections that offer a novel perspective on historical events, enhancing the originality of the analysis.

**Overall Rating**

- **Holistic Assessment Guidance:**

- Provide a guideline for raters to consider the article's cumulative strengths across dimensions, emphasizing the importance of a balanced assessment that values both the depth of content and its presentation.
- Highlight the need for raters to articulate a rationale for the overall rating, focusing on the article's contribution to knowledge, engagement, and discourse in its field, without averaging the scores mechanically.

**Without Providing Examples:**

- **Criterion for Each Dimension:** Ensure each criterion within a dimension is clearly defined and actionable, allowing raters to apply it consistently without the need for external examples.
- **Descriptive Anchors:** For each point on the rating scale, provide descriptive anchors that detail the characteristics of content that would merit that rating, focusing on qualitative descriptions of what constitutes, for example, "Comprehensive" historical context or "Highly Original" insights.
- **Rater Calibration:** Organize calibration sessions for raters where they review and discuss sample articles (not shared with writers) to align on the application of criteria, ensuring consistent interpretation and application of the framework across articles.

This approach to refining the criteria ensures that the framework can be applied effectively and consistently, even in the absence of specific examples, by providing clear, actionable guidance for each dimension of assessment.

```
- Update the criteria to reflect 2, 3, and 7 based on their first bullet.
- Provide guidance on if the updates mentioned in 6 are limited to 6 or if an additional parameter is needed.
- Update the notes for application to include the holistic assessment guidance.
- Provide additional information for implementing descriptive anchors.
```

To refine the criteria for dimensions 2, 3, and 7 based on their first bullets, and to address your queries regarding dimension 6 and the implementation of descriptive anchors, the following updates and guidance are provided:

Updated Criteria for Dimensions:

**2. Depth of Historical Context**

- **Revised Criterion:**

- **Integration with Main Narrative:** Evaluate how the historical context is woven into the article's main narrative, ensuring it directly enhances the reader's understanding of the topic without detracting from the primary focus.

**3. Ratio of Informational Content vs Filler Words**

- **Revised Criterion:**

- **Direct Contribution to Objectives:** Assess whether the content directly contributes to the article's objectives, such as enhancing understanding, providing insight, or supporting an argument, while minimizing redundant or unnecessary elaboration.

**7. Originality and Uniqueness**

- **Revised Criterion:**

- **Fresh Angle on Well-Covered Topics:** Evaluate the article for its approach to common topics from a fresh angle or for uncovering lesser-known aspects, thereby offering new insights or perspectives.

### Guidance on Dimension 6 and Additional Parameter

The updates mentioned for dimension 6 emphasize presenting a well-rounded analysis and contextualizing historical events within contemporary issues. This guidance is specifically tailored for critical analysis and interpretation, focusing on depth and breadth of insight. If the articles under review span beyond historical analysis to include, for example, cultural, social, or technological topics, it may be beneficial to introduce an additional parameter that assesses **Relevance and Application**:

- **Relevance and Application:** Assess the ability of the article to connect its main subject with broader contemporary issues, trends, or debates, demonstrating the topic's ongoing relevance and implications for today's audience.
- **Holistic Assessment Guidance:** In the overall rating, raters should consider the article's strengths across all dimensions, focusing on its cumulative contribution to knowledge, reader engagement, and discourse. The overall rating should reflect a comprehensive assessment of the article's value, guided by specific criteria but also incorporating the rater's informed judgment about the piece's impact and significance as a whole.

**Implementing Descriptive Anchors**

Descriptive anchors provide a qualitative description of what characterizes each rating point on the scale for each criterion. To implement these effectively:

- **Define Specific Characteristics:** For each rating point (1 through 5), define specific characteristics or qualities that an article would exhibit to merit that rating. For example, a rating of "5" for Originality might be defined by the introduction of a novel theory or perspective not previously discussed in the literature.
- **Use Actionable Language:** Ensure the descriptions use actionable language that gives clear indications of what is required to achieve each rating level. For instance, "Uses primary sources to challenge existing narratives" could be a criterion for a higher rating in historical depth.
- **Consistency Training:** Conduct training sessions where raters use the descriptive anchors to rate several practice articles. Discuss the ratings to align on interpretations of each anchor, ensuring consistency.
- **Feedback Loop:** Use raters' experiences and feedback to refine the descriptive anchors over time, ensuring they remain relevant and clear as the content evolves.

Implementing these updates and guidance ensures that the assessment framework is robust, actionable, and adaptable, providing a solid foundation for evaluating articles across a spectrum of expertise and topics.

```
Provide a fully updated list of criteria, and a standardized format, that reflects off of the suggestions accept training and feedback loop as these would undermine the experiment.
```

Based on the updates and guidance provided, here is a fully revised list of criteria in a standardized format for assessing the quality of articles. This format omits training and feedback loops to align with the experimental design's requirements:

**Article Assessment Criteria:**

**Overall Rating**

- **Criteria for Rating:**

- Consider the article's cumulative strengths across all dimensions, focusing on its contribution to knowledge, engagement, and discourse. The overall rating reflects a comprehensive assessment of the article's impact and significance.

**Standardized Format for Criteria Application:**

- Each dimension is rated on a scale from 1 to 5, with descriptive anchors provided for each scale point to ensure clarity and consistency in application.
- The criteria for each dimension are focused on specific, measurable characteristics of the article's content and presentation.
- The overall rating is a holistic assessment, not a simple average, of the article's quality across all dimensions, emphasizing its overall contribution and impact.

This standardized format aims to provide a clear, consistent approach for assessing articles, ensuring that each dimension of quality is evaluated comprehensively and fairly, based on its contribution to the article's value and effectiveness.

```
What is the reason for some of the criteria having a scale of 1 to 5, while others do not?
```

The oversight in my previous response led to inconsistency in the presentation of criteria, where specific rating scales were detailed for some criteria (like Accuracy and Factual Correctness, Clarity and Coherence, and Engagement and Readability) but not for others that were updated based on your instructions (Depth of Historical Context, Ratio of Informational Content vs Filler Words, and Originality and Uniqueness). The intention was to provide a standardized approach across all criteria; however, the execution missed fully detailing the 1 to 5 scale for the updated criteria.

For a truly standardized format, each criterion should indeed have a clearly defined scale from 1 to 5, with descriptive anchors explaining what constitutes each level of the scale. This consistency is crucial for ensuring that all articles are evaluated fairly and comprehensively, allowing for nuanced assessment that accommodates articles of varying complexity and expertise.

Here's a clarification incorporating a uniform 1 to 5 scale across all criteria, including those previously lacking detailed scales:

**2. Depth of Historical Context (Clarified Scale)**

- **1 (Superficial):** Provides minimal or irrelevant historical context; lacks depth.
- **2 (Basic):** Includes some historical context, but it is cursory and may not fully enhance understanding.
- **3 (Good):** Offers a satisfactory amount of historical context that generally supports the main narrative.
- **4 (Very Good):** Provides rich historical context that clearly enhances the narrative and deepens understanding.
- **5 (Comprehensive):** Delivers exceptional depth in historical context, offering insightful connections and analyses that significantly enrich the narrative.

**3. Ratio of Informational Content vs Filler Words (Clarified Scale)**

- **1 (High Ratio of Filler):** Article is padded with unnecessary language, detracting from informational content.
- **2 (Moderate Ratio of Filler):** Contains some filler words, but there is a fair amount of useful information.
- **3 (Balanced):** Strikes a balance between informational content and necessary elaboration, with minimal filler.
- **4 (Low Ratio of Filler):** Predominantly informational content with very limited use of superfluous language.
- **5 (Highly Informational):** Content is dense with information, effectively eliminating filler and maximizing reader value.

**7. Originality and Uniqueness (Clarified Scale)**

- **1 (Derivative):** Offers little to no original thought; heavily relies on common knowledge or clichés.
- **2 (Somewhat Original):** Shows some signs of originality, but still closely follows established narratives or ideas.
- **3 (Moderately Original):** Balances between existing insights and new perspectives, providing a fresh take on some aspects.
- **4 (Very Original):** Presents unique insights or novel interpretations that distinguish it from typical discussions.
- **5 (Highly Original):** Breaks new ground by offering innovative perspectives or uncovering previously unexplored aspects, contributing significantly to the discourse.

The purpose of having a detailed 1 to 5 scale for each criterion is to ensure evaluators have a clear, structured method for assessing each article's strengths and weaknesses, facilitating more precise and objective feedback across a diverse range of submissions.

```
You still haven't provided a standardized version of item 6.
```

My apologies for the oversight. Let's rectify that by providing a standardized version of item 6, Critical Analysis and Interpretation, with a clear 1 to 5 scale and corresponding descriptive anchors.

**6. Critical Analysis and Interpretation (Standardized Scale)**

- **1 (Poor):** Offers little to no analysis or insight; merely summarizes content without delving into the implications or exploring different perspectives.
- **2 (Basic):** Provides some analysis, but it remains superficial; lacks depth in exploring the significance or offering varied viewpoints.
- **3 (Good):** Includes a solid level of analysis and interpretation, presenting relevant implications and considering some alternative perspectives.

### Challenging Oversights

There were a number of oversights on the AI's part that were somewhat surprising. Several of the interactions during criteria refinement were simply to point out items it had overlooked for failed to include. While it's tempting to revise the role to be inclusive of such tasks, I think I'll opt to see what happens when the rating takes place.
