<u></u>Image created with Midjourney v6 alpha### Preface

This post is part of a year-long <u>initiative where I employ AI to create content</u> about holiday traditions worldwide. The objective is to observe how various AI tools perform and improve in content creation with minimal human intervention over time. This is the 1st of 2 articles for the month of <u>July</u>.

*Prompts and interactions with different AI models will be documented as they occur, providing insights into the methodologies, challenges, and adjustments made throughout the project*

## TL;DR

I confirmed that role-specific findings remain relevant after recent model updates. Additionally, I found that the newer GPT for role creation shows no significant improvement over its predecessor. Both versions perform similarly, so I need to decide whether to refine the newer approach or stick with the existing one. Lastly, I tried using JSON as a replacement for Markdown, which produced mixed results.

## Trial Elements

### **AI Models:**

- Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- ChatGPT-4
- ChatGPT-4o

### **Holidays:**

1. July 4th in the United States
2. Tanabata (Star Festival) in Japan
3. Kupala Night in Ukraine

### **Goals:**

- Confirm that performance improvements from detailed role definitions remain applicable after recent model updates.
- Evaluate the effectiveness of third- and fourth-generation role makers across different AI models and input types.
- Test ChatGPT-4's ability to create charts for visualizing experimental findings.

## July 4th

To get started, I wanted to see if recent AI model updates had altered previous observations regarding role-based prompts. I began by defining a basic cultural journalist role focused on July 4th celebrations.

```
A cultural journalist that specializes in writing about United States holidays and Americana in general.
```

I then prompted each version of the GPT using the same input for role generation. The output types included Markdown, XML, and JSON, resulting in 24 articles. Afterward, I used ChatGPT-4 to chart the highest-scoring article for each round by AI model:

<u></u>Scores by model and input type for July 4th articlesFinally, when creating a chart of the highest-scoring articles, it was inaccurate, so I had it provide the scores to refresh its memory, and it was then able to create an accurate chart:

<u></u>Highest-scoring articles across all July 4th articlesThis need for correction highlighted some memory issues with ChatGPT-4 as well as the need for oversight.

## Tanabata and Kupala Night

For the next two holidays, I tested the latest role maker iterations with a generic prompt.

```
A cultural journalist that specializes in writing about holidays and observed days with an even balance between history, current practices, and the sentiment of the people who celebrate the event.
```

I generated a new role for every article to minimize bias from any role that might be particularly better than the others. I also added JSON as a new input type, in addition to XML, which has been supported for several versions.

Again, I had ChatGPT-4 create charts; however, this time I tasked it with making composites that included the highest-scoring articles from each AI, grouping them by article to demonstrate particularly strong combinations.

<u></u>Highest-scoring articles per role and input, per AI, grouped by article.<u></u>Highest-scoring articles per role and input, across AI, grouped by article.Throughout the process, each AI model exhibited its usual array of quirks and idiosyncrasies. These performance and output variations, while not groundbreaking, reinforced the need for flexibility when working with different AI systems.

## Insights & Observations

### The Good

- **Third-generation roles** consistently outperformed newer iterations across multiple tests.
- **JSON input** showed a lot of promise with each AI but requires more thoughtful application.
- **Claude's XML and JSON** capabilities proved highly efficient, streamlining data analysis.

### The Bad

- **Fourth-generation roles** underperformed expectations, requiring further refinement or abandonment.
- **Technical limitations** (e.g., Claude's five-file limit) occasionally required deviations from the process applied to other AI.
- **GPT-4o's unpredictable quality** raised questions about the trade-off between speed and reliability.

### The Ugly

ChatGPT-4, in combination with the JSON prompts, spiraled into an endless loop of self-analysis, rewriting the same section repeatedly. Perhaps the JSON is a little too good. It was like watching it tweak the same paragraph over and over again like Doctor Strange bargaining with Dormammu. üîÅ

## Up Next

- Conduct additional tests to gather a more comprehensive data set for analysis.
- Explore optimization strategies for JSON input, particularly with GPT-4.

### Writing Template

Claude 3.5 Sonnet was used to:

- Optimize the XML of the template, guidelines, writing-process.
- Convert all XML to JSON
