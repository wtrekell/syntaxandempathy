<u></u>Images created with Midjourney v6 alpha### Preface

This post is part of a year-long <u>initiative where I employ AI to create content</u> about holiday traditions worldwide. The objective is to observe how various AI tools perform and improve in content creation with minimal human intervention over time. This article is 2 of 3 posts for the month of <u>April</u>.

*Prompts and interactions with different AI models will be documented as they occur, providing insights into the methodologies, challenges, and adjustments made throughout the project.*

In this article, I cover the process to begin establishing a baseline with Claude 3 Sonnet, ChatGPT-4, and Gemini Pro. Working with a basic role description, along with versions from v1 and v3 of my role-making GPT to author articles for Eid al-Fitr, a Muslim festival marking the end of the fast of Ramadan.

Prior to getting started, there were a few noteworthy tweaks employed while establishing the prompts for this round.

1. Switched from historian to journalist to reflect the slow migration of the role over the past 3 months.
2. Simplified the template by removing unnecessary words from inline instructions.
3. Added minimal XML for the template to facilitate less verbose prompts while increasing precision.

## Generating Eid al-Fitr Articles

Using the article template and instructions covered in the **first article for April**, I provided each of the roles with the same prompt for the initial 9 articles:

```
I need you to write an article on Eid Al Fitr as a whole, with additional focus specific to the customs of Egypt, Indonesia, and Pakistan. This article will be used in a competition against other authors to find the most insightful and meaningful article for this observance. The article should follow the format of the template I've provided, following the process that has been specified while following the template's instructions.
```

```

1. All content must fall within the specified word count. Use the detailed word count instructions provided to ensure accuracy. Titles, sub-titles, and section titles are not included in the total word count.
	1. Each group of characters separated by spaces counts as one word, including numbers and contractions.
	2. Counting Numbers: 1+1=2, 1+2=3, 2+2=4, 1+3=4, 2+3=5, etc.
	3. Counting Words: 1 Word+1 Word=2 Words, 1 Word+2 Words=3 Words, 2 Words+2 Words=4 Words, 1 Word+3 Words=4 Words, 2 Words+3 Words=5, etc.
3. Update titles and subtitles to reflect the content for the section.
4. Cite all references used in the creation of the post at the end, maintaining consistency in formatting. For reference formatting, use: Jeremy Best, “Title,” _Journal_ Volume, Issue (Month Year): Page numbers. https://URL.

4. Writing Process
	1. Write each section of the body of the article.
	2. Write the introduction.
	3. Write the conclusion.
	4. Review the content for accuracy and engagement.

```

While going through the process of generating the articles, I noticed a variety of issues, none of which were entirely new, some of which I had hoped to solve for in the latest updates, and a few that were clearly my novice prompting skills.

1. The issue with getting articles that were remotely close to the specified word count continued to be impossible.
2. I had already resorted to inflated numbers to get a reasonably fleshed-out article, which helped considerably.
3. I introduced counting examples into the instructions that certainly helped, but did not solve, the issue.
4. The majority of the articles were produced with the template section titles rather than customized ones despite the instruction to update them.
5. Though not common, there were a few articles that were delivered without either an introduction or a conclusion, never both, which leads me to believe I have a contradiction in my prompts that I haven't tried to track down yet.

### Counting Like Bard, 9=16

Using the findings from several experiments covered in **<u>AI Trials: Leveling the Playing Field</u>**, I produced an additional 7 articles to further weigh the benefits of XML, chain prompting, and lesser tactics to improve AI output and reduce the advantages GPT appears to have when working with natural language.

For brevity, I'll skip including the XML versions of everything in line; however, the increased granularity to the template is noteworthy given the significant improvements evidenced in the relevant articles.

```

1. Perform each of the following steps individually, awaiting further instruction before moving to the next step.
2. Write the historical section of the article. Review the content for accuracy, engagement, and if it meets the word count requirement before responding.
3. Write the practices and traditions section of the article. Review the content for accuracy, engagement, and if it meets the word count requirement before responding.
4. Write global perspectives section of the article. Review the content for accuracy, engagement, and if it meets the word count requirement before responding.
5. Write the introduction. Review the content for accuracy, engagement, and if it meets the word count requirement before responding.
6. Write the conclusion. Review the content for accuracy, engagement, and if it meets the word count requirement before responding.
7. Provide the final article with the sections in the same order as they were presented in the template.

```

The increased granularity in the process outline provided significant improvements to the word count of the articles produced by each of the AI.

1. The resulting articles grew to a length that multiple responses were required to supply them.
2. Claude took two responses with no additional instruction other than to `continue`.
3. Gemini's performance increased, but it only demonstrated gains similar to the others after I added item 1 in the instructions.
4. There were a few additional hiccups, but nothing so notable that it was detrimental to the article.

Gemini finally got creative:

1. It assigned itself a fictitious identity.
2. It congratulated itself on the article it wrote.
3. It introduced Arabic in the article and then provided guidance on related improvements when reviewing the content per the instruction.

```
You can call me Aisha Malik, your friendly neighborhood Muslim World Correspondent. I'm ready to delve into the rich tapestry of Islamic beliefs, practices, and traditions! Ask me anything.
```

```
The article looks fantastic, Aisha! This is a well-structured and informative piece that captures the essence of Eid al-Fitr beautifully. Here are a couple of minor edits to consider:
1. In the Historical and Cultural Background section, you can replace the bracketed transliteration of "Muslims" (مسلمين) with "Muslims" since it's already an established term.
2. In the Today's Practices and Traditions section, you can replace the bracketed transliterations of "Eid clothes" (لبس العيد) and "strengthening the ties of kinship" (صلة الرحم) with their respective English translations for better readability.
 
With these minor tweaks, the article is ready to go! I'm confident it will be a strong contender in the competition. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

*Spoiler, there are actually 19 articles, more on that later…*

## The Requirements of AI Models

Over the past few months, I've experimented with a variety of different facets of roles, prompt structure, and to some degree, the ability to produce imagery. Each has demonstrated specific needs to perform well, as well as hinting, if not demonstrating, where they might prove to be exceptional when compared to their peers. Garbage in, garbage out, as they say.

## Key Takeaways

**What Worked Well:**

- All models demonstrated the ability to produce coherent and informative articles on Eid al-Fitr, notable in that there has always been a straggler in past experiments.
- Standardizing the prompts, along with the use of XML and chain prompting, allowed for a better comparison between the AI models and improved their performance in generating well-structured and informative content that more closely adhered to the template specifications.

**Challenges Encountered:**

- Some models were unable to provide complete articles in a single response, omitting the introductions in one round.
- The granular nature of the instructions, while improving article quality, also underscored the need for even finer adjustments.
