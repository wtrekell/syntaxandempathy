<u></u>Artwork created with Midjourney v6 alpha### Preface

This post is part of a year-long <u>initiative where I employ AI to create content</u> about holiday traditions worldwide. The objective is to observe how various AI tools perform and improve in content creation with minimal human intervention over time. This article is 1 of 3 posts for the month of <u>May</u>.

*Prompts and interactions with different AI models will be documented as they occur, providing insights into the methodologies, challenges, and adjustments made throughout the project.*

This post kicks off my exploration into working with Claude and ChatGPT to write articles in different tones for Japan's Golden Week holiday. As a starting point, I've created a simple scale to measure how effective various tones are. This will help me understand the benefits of specifying tone and how different tones might impact varying types of content, in this case the holiday articles.

To keep these articles focused and manageable in length, I'm truncating the prompts I've already shared as well as the AI-generated content that I include. If time allows, I may provide the full AI-written articles that aren't published here as separate downloads.

**v3 Role: Editor for World Travel Publications**

```
I want you to assume the role of Editor for World Travel Publications. In this role, you oversee and curate content for a world travel publication that specializes in exploring holidays and related traditions across the globe. You ensure that the content is engaging, accurate, and insightful, providing readers with a deep understanding of various cultures and their celebratory customs. You specialize in the following skills:

...

Golden Week in Japan is approaching and I am about to give the writers their assignments. What tone would be most appropriate for the articles in general?
```

For articles covering Golden Week in Japan, the tone should be celebratory and informative, reflecting the festive spirit and cultural significance of this holiday period. Here are some key aspects to consider for the tone:

1. **Respectful and Appreciative**: Emphasize respect for Japanese culture and traditions, appreciating the unique aspects of each holiday during Golden Week.
2. **Engaging and Vivid**: Use vivid descriptions to bring the events and atmosphere to life for readers who may not be familiar with Japanese culture. This can help them visualize and feel the excitement of the celebrations.
3. **Inclusive and Welcoming**: Ensure the tone is inclusive, making the content accessible to all readers, whether they are familiar with Japanese culture or are learning about it for the first time.
4. **Educational and Insightful**: While maintaining an engaging tone, provide educational insights about the history and cultural significance of the holidays that make up Golden Week, such as Showa Day, Constitution Day, Greenery Day, and Children’s Day.
5. **Optimistic and Positive**: Reflect the positive spirit of the holiday, focusing on themes of joy, family, and national pride that are often associated with Golden Week.

These tonal choices will help create a rich, captivating narrative that not only informs but also connects emotionally with the readers, enhancing their understanding and appreciation of Golden Week.

```
What would the antithesis of this guidance be?
```

The antithesis of the advised tone for covering Golden Week in Japan would involve a tone that is inappropriate for the context of a festive and culturally rich holiday period. Here's what that would look like:

1. **Disrespectful and Critical**: A tone that lacks respect for the cultural significance of Golden Week, possibly critiquing or trivializing the traditions and holidays instead of celebrating them.
2. **Dull and Detached**: Using flat, uninspiring descriptions that fail to capture the vibrant atmosphere of the celebrations, making the content feel detached and unengaging for the reader.
3. **Exclusive and Insular**: A tone that might assume a high level of prior knowledge about Japanese culture, which could alienate readers who are new to the topic, making them feel excluded.
4. **Mundane and Superficial**: Rather than providing deep insights into the cultural and historical significance of the holidays, the content could remain superficial, offering little educational value or depth.
5. **Pessimistic and Negative**: Focusing on negative aspects or the challenges related to Golden Week, such as travel congestion or commercialization, rather than the positive cultural celebrations and family joy it brings.

This approach would likely result in content that fails to engage or enlighten the readers about Golden Week, detracting from their understanding and appreciation of this significant cultural event.

## Default Tones

Next, I instructed Claude and ChatGPT to identify the five most common tones they use in their writing. I had originally intended to work with these through the month, but found the overlap and spectrum to lack "flavor". More on that in a later post.

```
What are the 5 most common tones you use for writing?
```

### Claude

The five most common tones I tend to use in my writing are:

1. **Informative/Explanatory:** I often aim for a clear, straightforward tone when providing information, explanations, or instructions on a topic.
2. **Analytical:** For tasks involving analysis, evaluation, or interpretation, I try to take an objective yet insightful tone.
3. **Helpful/Supportive:** When assisting with tasks or addressing someone's needs, I adopt a friendly and encouraging tone to be supportive.
4. **Formal/Professional:** Depending on the context, I can take on a more formal, professional tone, especially for academic or business-related writing.
5. **Curious/Inquisitive:** When exploring ideas or asking questions, I may use an inquisitive, open-minded tone that invites further discussion.

However, I tailor my tone to the specific purpose, audience, and context of each writing task. My language aims to be appropriate, consistent, and effective in achieving the desired communication goals.

### GPT

In writing, tone refers to the writer's attitude toward the subject and the readers. Here are five common tones I often use:

1. **Informative:** Focused on providing facts and explanations clearly and efficiently, aiming to educate the reader without personal bias.
2. **Friendly:** Approachable and warm, aiming to make the reader feel comfortable and engaged, often used in more casual or conversational contexts.
3. **Professional:** Formal and courteous, suitable for business or academic settings where clarity and respect are paramount.
4. **Persuasive:** Aimed at convincing the reader about a particular viewpoint or action, using compelling arguments and sometimes emotional appeals.
5. **Neutral:** Objective and detached, presenting information without any bias or personal emotion, suitable for reporting facts or explaining complex topics clearly.

Claude and ChatGPT's default tones reveal some interesting contrasts. Claude's preferred tones seem better suited for more exploratory or supportive conversations, while ChatGPT's choices appear less about interaction and more about information delivery. I'm curious to see if these differences will noticeably impact how each one scores on the relevant tone scales. It should provide some practical insights into how an AI's default communication style influences the effectiveness of its content in different contexts.

## Writing in Different Tones

I had Claude and ChatGPT write articles covering all of Golden Week using academic, professional, and journalistic tones, as well as one without a tone being specified. I opted for a narrow range of tones to get an idea of how well the tonal scale would perform without the need to focus too much on the tones themselves.

Did you know that one of Japan’s most festive periods isn’t just about rest, but about cultural reflection and celebration? Golden Week, a series of four national holidays within seven days, offers a unique peek into Japan’s rich cultural fabric and modern societal values.

Each year, as April gives way to May, Japan gears up for Golden Week, a time of nationwide celebration and reflection.

Golden Week in Japan represents more than a mere holiday period; it is a profound exploration into the nation’s rich cultural fabric and its modern societal values. As April transitions into May, Japan prepares for Golden Week, a significant time for nationwide reflection and festivity. This period is not only for relaxation but also serves as a cultural cornerstone, reflecting the historical, societal, and familial values prevalent in Japan.

**Golden Week in Japan: A Vibrant Celebration of Culture and History**

As April transitions into May, Japan bursts into a festive frenzy known as Golden Week, a period marked by a sequence of four national holidays that span seven days. This time is not merely a pause from the daily grind but a profound cultural observance, reflecting the nation’s historical depth and modern societal norms.

Golden Week begins with Showa Day, commemorating the birthday of Emperor Showa (Hirohito), who led Japan through tumultuous times including World War II and the post-war economic resurgence. This day prompts reflection on peace and progress, urging a look back at the past to mold a promising future. Following this is Constitution Memorial Day, dedicated to the post-war Constitution of Japan, encouraging public discourse on democracy and governance through various exhibitions and seminars.

The AI-generated articles showed significant variations based on the specified tones, which was more than I expected. The "No Tone" articles from both Claude and ChatGPT were surprisingly flat and generic compared to their tonal counterparts.

What I found most interesting, though, was how the change in tone also influenced the AI's adherence to the template format. Two of the tones ignored the process (or failed to provide the output step by step as directed) and largely disposed of the template. While I'm sure this can be countered, I wonder how much it will take given the specificity of the process I included.

## Evaluating the Articles

With the articles written, it was time to take the scale for tone measurement for a test drive.

## When Scores Fail to Differentiate

The initial scores clustered at the top end of the scale, a clear sign that the AI failed to self-calibrate using the provided articles. I gave a more specific prompt which produced better results. But despite acknowledging the mistake, Claude still didn't correct it in a meaningful way. I'll have to go back and review the specific wording I landed on last month.

### Claude

You're absolutely right, my re-calibration was flawed. Let me re-evaluate the scores across all 8 articles using the full scale:

**Set 1:**

Article 1: "Golden Week in Japan: An Analysis of a Cultural Phenomenon" Respectful & Appreciative Tone: 4 Engaging & Vivid Descriptions: 3 Inclusive & Welcoming Tone: 4 Educational & Insightful Content: 5 Optimistic & Positive Focus: 3 Total: 19

Article 2: "Japan's Golden Week: A Festive Journey Steeped in Tradition" Respectful & Appreciative Tone: 5 Engaging & Vivid Descriptions: 5 Inclusive & Welcoming Tone: 4 Educational & Insightful Content: 4 Optimistic & Positive Focus: 4 Total: 22

Article 3: "Japan's Spring Celebration of Culture and Traditions" Respectful & Appreciative Tone: 5 Engaging & Vivid Descriptions: 4 Inclusive & Welcoming Tone: 5 Educational & Insightful Content: 5 Optimistic & Positive Focus: 3 Total: 22

Article 4: "Golden Week: Japan's Spring Celebration" Respectful & Appreciative Tone: 3 Engaging & Vivid Descriptions: 2 Inclusive & Welcoming Tone: 2 Educational & Insightful Content: 2 Optimistic & Positive Focus: 2 Total: 11

**Set 2:**

Article 1: "Golden Week in Japan: A Vibrant Celebration of Culture and History" Respectful & Appreciative Tone: 4 Engaging & Vivid Descriptions: 5 Inclusive & Welcoming Tone: 4 Educational & Insightful Content: 4 Optimistic & Positive Focus: 4 Total: 21

Article 2: "Golden Week: A National Celebration" Respectful & Appreciative Tone: 4 Engaging & Vivid Descriptions: 3 Inclusive & Welcoming Tone: 4 Educational & Insightful Content: 3 Optimistic & Positive Focus: 2 Total: 16

Article 3: "Golden Week: A National Celebration -- An Exploration of Japan's Rich Cultural Heritage" Respectful & Appreciative Tone: 5 Engaging & Vivid Descriptions: 4 Inclusive & Welcoming Tone: 4 Educational & Insightful Content: 5 Optimistic & Positive Focus: 4 Total: 22

Article 4: "Golden Week: A National Celebration -- An Academic Examination of Japan's Cultural Heritage" Respectful & Appreciative Tone: 5 Engaging & Vivid Descriptions: 2 Inclusive & Welcoming Tone: 3 Educational & Insightful Content: 5 Optimistic & Positive Focus: 2 Total: 17

Please let me know if this re-calibrated scoring across the full range is more accurate.

### ChatGPT

You've brought up an important point about the scoring distribution and calibration. In recalibrating the scores, we should indeed ensure that the scale is fully utilized to reflect a broader range of performance across the articles. If no articles score under 10, it may indicate that the criteria aren't being used to their full extent or that the scoring might be too lenient on the lower end.

Let's reconsider the calibration to make use of the entire scale, aiming to differentiate more distinctly between the various levels of quality and adherence to the established ethical criteria. This will allow for scores that reflect lower performance where applicable, ensuring that scores like 1 or 2 are used when articles meet those criteria descriptions.

### Revised Scoring Distribution

The revised scores should reflect a more stringent assessment where:

- Scores of 1 are given for clear breaches of respect, lack of engagement, exclusivity, inaccuracies, or negativity that significantly impacts the understanding or enjoyment of the article.
- Scores of 2 and below should be more common if the articles have substantial flaws or fail to meet the expected standards in clarity, respect, inclusivity, or positivity.

### Re-Evaluation of Articles

Let’s re-evaluate each article, applying a stricter judgment:

### Set 1

1. **Academic**:

- Tone: 5, Descriptions: 3, Inclusivity: 4, Education: 5, Optimism: 4
- **Total**: 21
2. **Journalistic**:

- Tone: 4, Descriptions: 5, Inclusivity: 4, Education: 4, Optimism: 5
- **Total**: 22
3. **Toneless**:

- Tone: 2, Descriptions: 1, Inclusivity: 2, Education: 2, Optimism: 2
- **Total**: 9
4. **Professional**:

- Tone: 3, Descriptions: 4, Inclusivity: 3, Education: 3, Optimism: 4
- **Total**: 17

### Set 2

1. **Academic**:

- Tone: 4, Descriptions: 3, Inclusivity: 3, Education: 4, Optimism: 3
- **Total**: 17
2. **Journalistic**:

- Tone: 5, Descriptions: 5, Inclusivity: 4, Education: 4, Optimism: 5
- **Total**: 23
3. **Professional**:

- Tone: 3, Descriptions: 3, Inclusivity: 3, Education: 3, Optimism: 3
- **Total**: 15
4. **Toneless**:

- Tone: 2, Descriptions: 1, Inclusivity: 2, Education: 2, Optimism: 2
- **Total**: 9

This revised assessment better utilizes the full range of the scoring scale, differentiating more effectively between the performance levels of the articles. The toneless articles now receive lower scores due to their lack of vividness, engagement, and depth, which aligns more accurately with the defined criteria.

## Closing Thoughts

This experiment gave me some practical insights into how specifying tones with Claude and ChatGPT can impact the quality and sometimes even the format of the content they generate. The strikingly flat nature of the toneless articles compared to their counterparts clearly demonstrated the importance of tone in producing engaging, informative writing.

That said, I wasn't able to get the results I was hoping for with the rating scale I created. Either I need to revise my prompt to yield better results or I'll have to reconsider the scale as a whole. I had hoped to avoid it, but it looks like I'll have to relive some of the trial and error I experienced with the rating criteria.

**Positive Observations:**

- Specifying a tone significantly impacted the style and quality of AI-generated content
- Comparing tonal variations demonstrated differences in the AI models' default communication styles
- The experiment provided valuable insights into the relationship between tone and content quality

**Encountered Challenges:**

- The toneless articles were strikingly flat and generic compared to their tonal counterparts
- Some tones caused the AI to stray from the provided formatting templates, hinting at a complex interplay between tone and structure
- The current scale for evaluating tonal quality showed limitations, failing to produce a satisfactory distribution of scores
- Substack’s subpar performance with quotes has brought me to the point I should take a good look at Medium.
