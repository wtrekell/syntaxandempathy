<u></u>Image created with Midjourney v6 alpha### Preface

This post is part of a year-long <u>initiative where I employ AI to create content</u> about holiday traditions worldwide. The objective is to observe how various AI tools perform and improve in content creation with minimal human intervention over time. This article is the last of 3 for the month of <u>June</u>.

*Prompts and interactions with different AI models will be documented as they occur, providing insights into the methodologies, challenges, and adjustments made throughout the project*

June Pt 3 supplements the findings in <u>June Pt 2</u> by documenting the roles and templates used in the experiments that explored Claude's and ChatGPT-4's ability to maintain a consistent tone across articles about Eid al-Adha celebrations in Bangladesh and Egypt.
