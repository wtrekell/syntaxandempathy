Image created with Midjourney v6.1This post is part of a year-long <u>initiative where I employ AI to create content</u> about holiday traditions worldwide. The objective is to observe how various AI tools perform and improve in content creation with minimal human intervention over time. This is the 1st of 3 articles for the month of <u>August</u>.

*Prompts and interactions with different AI models will be documented as they occur, providing insights into the methodologies, challenges, and adjustments made throughout the project*

## August Experiments Pt 1

## TL;DR

Building on <u>July's</u> results, I made a few final tweaks to the Minion Maker and fully committed to JSON-formatted roles. This new roles exceeded expectations, not only improving role performance but doing so with more efficient definitions. While JSON proved better for role definitions, XML remained marginally more effective for step-by-step instructions. I'll need to experiment with this further at a later point.

## Trial Elements

### AI Models

- Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- ChatGPT-4o

### Holidays

1. Flooding of the Nile Celebrations - Ancient Egypt

### Goals

- Evaluate the effectiveness of the newer version of JSON-formatted roles
- Compare the output quality when using JSON roles with XML and JSON templates
- Analyze the scoring process and results across multiple rounds of content creation

## Flooding of the Nile

I started August by validating Minion Maker improvements based on the findings from July, assessing the updated role definitions' performance. The JSON roles performed better than I had expected for each role, while XML maintained its value for the step-by-step instructions when scoring articles with ChatGPT-4.

Claude 3.5 Sonnet and ChatGPT-4o successfully wrote comprehensive articles using both JSON and XML article templates. Interestingly, Claude provided unsolicited word counts, despite only being asked to review them internally. This prompted me to request the same from ChatGPT-4o, revealing notable accuracy differences. While Claude's counts were consistently off, ChatGPT-4o demonstrated significant improvement over prior performances of this task, its only error being a single word discrepancy in the introduction.

For the scoring portion, both AIs performed well. ChatGPT-4 performed as desired with the XML version, albeit it swapped the last two steps but still produced expected results. However, when using the JSON template, I had to remind ChatGPT-4 to use tenths instead of whole and half numbers to avoid ties. Despite this, ChatGPT-4's JSON-based article achieved the highest score in 3 out of 4 rounds, demonstrating its overall effectiveness.

The image description from the new artist/photographer role demonstrated improved quality, although this may be due to the recent Midjourney update to v6.1.

## Insights & Observations

### The Good

- **JSON role efficiency**: The new JSON-formatted roles proved highly effective, allowing for more compact and precise instructions.
- **Flexible prompt handling**: I was able to incorporate larger prompts by interspersing instructions between JSON and XML code chunks without issue.

### The Bad

- **Persistent word count issues**: While improved, some inaccuracies in word count reporting persisted, particularly with Claude 3.5 Sonnet.
- **XML preference for processes**: Despite the overall success of JSON roles, ChatGPT-4 showed a continued preference for XML in process-driven prompts.

### The Ugly

ChatGPT-4 continues to insist on XML for process-driven prompts like a recovering XSLT addict. It seems we may need a support group to help it fully embrace the bracket-based lifestyle 💊

## Up Next

- Explore natural language prompting techniques to enhance both article templates and scoring criteria
- Investigate the persistent preference for XML in process-driven prompts and develop strategies to optimize format usage
