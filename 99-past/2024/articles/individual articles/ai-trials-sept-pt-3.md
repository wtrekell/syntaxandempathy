<u></u>Image created with Midjourney v6.1### Preface

This post is part of a year-long <u>initiative where I employ AI to create content</u> about holiday traditions worldwide. The objective is to observe how various AI tools perform and improve in content creation with minimal human intervention over time. This is the 3rd of 4 (maybe 5) articles for the month of <u>September</u>.

*Prompts and interactions with different AI models will be documented as they occur, providing insights into the methodologies, challenges, and adjustments made throughout the project*

## TL;DR

In September Pt 3, I challenged AI authors with diverse subjects and inputs, pushing them to adapt existing templates and evaluation methods. I tested their ability to handle a multi-day festival without explicit instructions, which yielded unexpected pleasant results. I also conducted tests using a wider variety of markup languages‚ÄîJSON, Markdown, TOML, XML, and YAML‚Äîto assess their impact on AI-generated content quality. By employing o1-mini for analysis, I uncovered trends suggesting that I may have prematurely settled on JSON as the optimal format.

## Trial Elements

### AI Models

- Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- ChatGPT-4o
- o1-mini

### Holidays

1. Ethiopian New Year - September 11th - Ethiopia
2. Onam - September 5th to 15th - Hindu communities worldwide
3. Mexico's Independence Day - September 15th

### Goals

- Evaluate tempalte performance across different markup languages
- Analyze trends in AI-generated content using o1-mini
- Test AI authors' ability to adapt templates for multi-day celebrations

## Ethiopian New Year

For the first event this round, I focused on the Ethiopian New Year. I limited activities to producing articles using one-shot and few-shot prompts, which I planned to use in upcoming tests. With most September holidays clustered in the first few weeks, I will also use these articles for trend analysis later.

While creating charts for this set of articles, I noticed an interesting pattern. Claude's scoring remained remarkably consistent across different rubrics, while GPT-4o exhibited more variation without contradicting itself.

<u></u>## Onam

Onam presented a unique challenge: a 10-day festival that would test our AI authors' ability to handle a complex, multi-day event without explicit guidance. I subtly modified my standard prompt, indicating that the author should adapt the template as needed for the event. Beyond that, I left them to their own devices.

To spice things up, I included my JSON author role alongside the author role I've been working with this month. This allowed me to compare articles and assess the impact of role specificity on handling complex events.

All four AI sessions (two each for Claude and GPT-4o) surprised me by integrating information about different days throughout their articles, eschewing the day-by-day breakdown I had anticipated. When questioning their approach, each AI provided solid reasoning for their choices. This unexpected twist not only demonstrated the flexibility of the new templates but also demonstrated improvements within the AI models or their respective updates since my last experience with a similar event.

### Scoring Comparison: The Impact of Role Specificity

As the month progressed, my curiosity about the performance of the new templates and how they might affect my JSON author grew. Rather than having the authors write smaller articles for each day of Onam, I opted for a comparison between articles generated by the JSON author role and those created with less specific prompts.

<u></u>Here's where things get interesting, the JSON author consistently produced the highest-scoring articles. However, some articles generated by the basic role outperformed the lowest-scoring JSON author pieces. It's worth noting that the prompt instructing the basic role included a reasonable paragraph providing context for the author. This raises questions about whether the JSON format might be as restrictive as it is structured, despite offering the same level of event context.

## Mexico's Independence Day

For my final experiment, I tested the impact of markup languages on AI-generated content using Mexico's Independence Day as the subject. To explore a range of possibilities, I transformed our Markdown template into several formats:

- <u>JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)</u>
- <u>Markdown (MD)</u>
- <u>Tom's Obvious Minimal Language (TOML)</u>
- <u>Extensible Markup Language (XML)</u>
- "<u>YAML Ain't Markup Language</u>" or "Yet Another Markup Language." (YAML) [<u>1</u>]

This produced 20 articles, which I scored using the JSON editor with both established rubrics. To ensure a thorough analysis, I employed two AI "researchers" for initial assessment. I then fed their reports to o1-mini for a comprehensive trend analysis.

<u></u>While many of o1-mini's insights aligned with my expectations, a few findings stood out:

- **Performance by Format:**

- **Researcher 1** identifies that articles in **YAML** and **XML** formats tend to score higher (7.80 to 8.02), whereas **JSON** and **TOML** formats fall into a mid-to-upper range (7.50 to 7.90).
- **Researcher 2** highlights that **TOML** files consistently achieve the highest scores (up to **8.95**), followed by **XML**, **JSON**, and **YAML** formats in descending order.
- **Naming Conventions and Specific File Types:**

- **Researcher 1** points out that files with names like **"GPT+YAML-GPTt.md"** achieve the highest scores, suggesting that GPT augmentation in specific formats enhances quality.
- **Researcher 2** observes that **"Ct.md"** files generally score higher than their **"GPTt.md"** counterparts, implying that non-GPT-enhanced versions may receive more meticulous attention or different processing methods.
- **Top-Performing Articles:**

- **Researcher 1** identifies specific high-scoring articles such as **SE-MI-FP-GPT+YAML-GPTt.md (8.02)** and **SE-MI-FP-GPT+XML-GPTt.md (7.96)**, highlighting their excellence in factual accuracy, cultural representation, and sensitivity.
- **Researcher 2** points out **SE-MI-FP-C+TOML-Ct.md (8.95)** as the highest scorer, emphasizing the superior performance of TOML-formatted articles.
- **Consistent Ranking Patterns Across File Types**

- **Researcher 2** observes a consistent ranking pattern across different file types: **Ct > TOML-GPTt > XML-GPTt > JSON-GPTt > YAML-GPTt**, which aligns partially with Researcher 1‚Äôs findings on format performance.

Of all the markup languages I tested, TOML was the one I assumed to see the least interesting results from. However, I'm not rushing to conclusions just yet. The experiment's scope was limited‚Äîwe only examined a single holiday with four articles per markup language. While this is certainly noteworthy, it's far from definitive.

## Insights & Observations

### The Good

- AI models demonstrated unexpected adaptability when handling multi-day events.
- Our markup language experiment revealed potential benefits of formats beyond JSON.

### The Bad

- Testing multiple templates and rubrics ended the Onam experiment prematurely.
- New model releases with built-in Chain of Thought capabilities raise questions about the value of the AI Trials in general.

### The Ugly

Claude's incessant apologizing has reached new heights of annoyance. I'm considering a prompt to ban phrases like "I'm sorry" just to have a normal conversation. At this rate, I half expect Claude to start offering virtual coffee and donuts to make up for its perceived shortcomings. üç©

## Up Next

- Merge templates and rubrics to streamline our experimental process.
- Conduct a broader study on markup language effectiveness across steps in my approach.
- Investigate o1-mini's potential for enhancing and expediting content generation and analysis.
