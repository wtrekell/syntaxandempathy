<u></u>### Preface

This post is part of a year-long <u>initiative where I employ AI to create content</u> about holiday traditions worldwide. The objective is to observe how various AI tools perform and improve in content creation with minimal human intervention over time. This is the 3rd of 3 articles for the month of <u>October</u>.

*Prompts and interactions with different AI models will be documented as they occur, providing insights into the methodologies, challenges, and adjustments made throughout the project*

## TL;DR

In October Pt 3, I shifted from the normal experimentation to explore how AI models handled Halloween's historical perspectives. I generated 14 articles spanning from ancient Celtic traditions to modern celebrations. Each piece represented a distinct historical perspective, which I evaluated through our standard scoring process. Though I had hoped for some AI shenanigans, both models maintained their professional composure throughout.

## Context: üëÅÔ∏è üñ§ üéÉ

My love for Halloween extends beyond candy and costumes to its ancient Celtic roots. These traditions transformed from solemn rituals honoring the dead to today's playful celebrations, demonstrating how cultures preserve and reinvent their customs. These changes reflect our modern challenges of maintaining cultural traditions alive while allowing natural evolution.

For Halloween, I decided to get far more serious about being entertaining myself.

## Article Creation

I utilized Perplexity to construct a comprehensive timeline of Samhain/Halloween, tracing its evolution from Celtic traditions to modern celebrations. This research identified key historical personas and cultural shifts that served as the foundation for the period pieces. Using my GPT role maker, I created detailed personas for each historical figure, capturing the perspective and cultural context of their specific time period.

The prompts used to create and employ the historical personas can be found in the appendix of each article.

## Scoring and Analysis

I reviewed the content with a mix of curiosity and amusement. Using the established rubric and 14 distinct articles, I assigned the AI editors the task of evaluation and scoring. Despite my hopes for chaos, they maintained their professional demeanor throughout the process.

### Claude (New)

Claude surprised me by creating a dashboard with supplementary information and its first-ever interactive chart, despite not having specific instructions for analyzing and sharing trends.

<u></u>1. **Scoring Variances:**

- Analyst 1 used a narrower scoring range (6.52-8.59)
- Analyst 2 used a wider range (4.80-9.45)
2. **Content Type Patterns:**

- Cultural/community-focused articles scored higher
- Colonial and authoritarian perspectives scored lower
- Religious/transformation narratives landed in the middle range

### o1-preview

The meta-analysis from o1-preview included text-based charts, they made me sad. I had to switch to GPT-4o for image-based visualizations. I should note that I did not specify which charts the AI should display, only that they should be provided.

<u></u>1. Perspective Impact:

- First-hand cultural accounts scored highest (8.90-9.45)
- Authority-based narratives scored lowest (4.80-5.20)
- Religious perspectives maintained middle-range scores (7.30-7.90)
2. Temporal Trends:

- Colonial-era pieces showed more cultural bias and scored lower
- 19th-century accounts demonstrated stronger cultural synthesis
- Mid-20th century pieces focused on community integration

## Visuals

Initial attempts at generating images with Midjourney were unsatisfactory due to vague prompt specifications. After analyzing the scoring data, I refined the prompts for the highest-scoring article from each AI model and produced complete versions with visuals. The remaining articles were left without visuals.

## Personality

The analysis showed that the two AIs categorized articles in a complementary yet mismatched manner. My impression is that o1-preview either omitted the druidic perspective or merged it into Christian-related religions, effectively neutralizing its influence. Although curious, I doubt the answer will make this round any more entertaining.

## Insights & Observations

### The Good

- I enjoyed myself considerably.

### The Bad

- The only thing I learned is that Claude can make interactive charts.

### The Ugly

My attempts to introduce chaos into AI experiments met unexpected professionalism from the AI models - like trying to instigate a food fight at a formal black-tie dinner. Despite explicit permission to take creative liberties with historical interpretations, the models maintained their serious demeanor, refusing to deviate from their dignified approach. ü•©üé©

13. **SH-GPT-Samhain_Hallo.md** - 8.54
14. **SH-GPT-colonial_auth.md** - 8.59

Here‚Äôs a detailed analysis highlighting trends across the articles, focusing on distinctions between those marked with "-C-" and "-GPT-", as well as overarching themes in content quality, cultural sensitivity, and historical integration.

### 1. **Comparative Scoring Trends (-C- vs. -GPT- Articles)**

   - **Higher Average Scores in -GPT- Articles**: Articles with "-GPT-" generally scored higher than "-C-" articles. The -GPT- articles had an average score of approximately 8.38, compared to an average of 8.07 in the -C- set. This suggests a consistent strength in narrative and contextual integration within the -GPT- articles, which contributed to their higher scores overall.
   - **Diversity and Depth in Cultural Representation**: Many "-GPT-" articles excelled in presenting multiple cultural perspectives, particularly in historical transitions between pagan and Christian practices, which may have contributed to higher scores in cultural sensitivity and educational value. "-C-" articles, though strong in historical authenticity, sometimes presented information with a narrower cultural scope or a more colonial perspective, which may have affected their inclusiveness scores.

### 2. **Cultural Sensitivity and Authenticity**

   - **-GPT- Articles Showcased Cultural Blending and Respect**: A major strength of the -GPT- articles was their portrayal of cultural blending, especially in discussions about Christian adaptations of Samhain. They handled cultural sensitivity with care, illustrating the respectful integration of practices rather than forced assimilation. Articles like *The Christian Transformation of Samhain* and *The Celtic Festival of Samhain and the Christian Path* highlighted the Church‚Äôs diplomatic approach to integrating Samhain, using detailed narratives to bridge pagan and Christian traditions in a way that respected both.
   - **Colonial and Religious Authority in -C- Articles**: In contrast, "-C-" articles often centered around authority figures (e.g., colonial officials or religious leaders) enforcing restrictions on traditional customs. These articles tended to score slightly lower in inclusiveness and cultural sensitivity, as the narratives occasionally leaned toward a more rigid or authoritative stance on indigenous practices. *A Discourse on Heathen Festivities* is a prime example, as its colonial viewpoint limited cultural inclusiveness.

### 3. **Research Accuracy and Contextual Relevance**

   - **Depth in Historical Detail Across All Articles**: Both -C- and -GPT- articles showed a strong foundation in historical accuracy, often referencing specific practices, festivals, and shifts over centuries. "-GPT-" articles like *The Harmonious Integration of Samhain into Roman Tradition* provided rich historical context, linking Samhain practices with Roman and early Christian festivals in a way that illustrated a smooth cultural evolution. This approach allowed for a more engaging narrative without compromising on factual accuracy.
   - **Narrative Consistency**: Articles with a broader historical context, such as *The Sacred Integration: From Samhain to All Saints' Day*, were more engaging due to logical flow and comprehensive coverage of different perspectives. "-C-" articles, while factually accurate, occasionally presented information in a more segmented or restrictive context, which could affect engagement and contextual relevance scores.

### 4. **Engagement, Narrative Quality, and Accessibility**

   - **Storytelling Strength in -GPT- Articles**: Articles under the "-GPT-" designation displayed a more vivid, immersive narrative style, with creative storytelling techniques that enhanced engagement. For example, *Samhain and Halloween Traditions in 19th-Century America* included personal accounts that connected readers with the immigrant experience, giving cultural traditions emotional resonance and relevance.
   - **Informational Tone in -C- Articles**: In contrast, many "-C-" articles took a more formal or instructional tone, especially when discussing colonial restrictions or religious adaptations of Samhain practices. This tone may have affected reader engagement by focusing on regulatory perspectives rather than on storytelling. Nonetheless, articles like *The Preservation of Our Sacred Traditions* balanced this by adding personal insights from community leaders, showing the importance of cultural identity within immigrant communities.

### 5. **Educational and Cultural Value**

   - **Modern Relevance and Broader Insights**: The -GPT- articles often emphasized broader cultural insights and modern relevance, which enhanced their educational value. By focusing on historical integration and the evolution of Halloween, these articles made cultural connections that resonate with contemporary readers. For instance, *The Story of How America Tamed Halloween* linked historical practices to the community-oriented Halloween celebrations familiar today, providing readers with a meaningful perspective on cultural adaptation.
   - **Focused Cultural Insights in -C- Articles**: Although strong in historical detail, the -C- articles generally provided less emphasis on broader educational connections. Their narratives were more concentrated on specific events, such as colonial regulations or ecclesiastical adaptations. This made them valuable for understanding discrete historical perspectives, though they scored slightly lower in offering broad, modern cultural insights.

### **Conclusion: Trends and Opportunities**

   - **Strengths in Narrative Depth and Cultural Integration**: The -GPT- articles consistently performed well by integrating cultural practices within a respectful, broad-reaching narrative that embraced both pagan and Christian traditions. Their storytelling approach and inclusion of multiple cultural insights made them highly engaging and culturally rich.
   - **Potential for Enhanced Inclusiveness in -C- Articles**: While the -C- articles were historically informative, expanding the cultural lens beyond the colonial or authoritative perspective could further improve their inclusiveness and narrative quality. Enhancing emotional resonance through community-focused storytelling could also increase reader engagement and accessibility.
  
These trends highlight the value of cultural blending, narrative inclusiveness, and modern relevance in elevating articles‚Äô impact on readers. Let me know if you'd like further insights on specific articles or categories!
