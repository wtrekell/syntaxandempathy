<u></u>Artwork created with Midjourney v6 alpha### Preface

This post is part of a year-long <u>initiative where I employ AI to create content</u> about holiday traditions worldwide. The objective is to observe how various AI tools perform and improve in content creation with minimal human intervention over time. This article is 3 of 3 posts for the month of <u>May</u>.

*Prompts and interactions with different AI models will be documented as they occur, providing insights into the methodologies, challenges, and adjustments made throughout the project.*

For this set of experiments, GPT-4, GPT-4o, and GPT-3.5 were assigned to write articles on cultural holidays. They were asked to score their articles using established criteria and provide image descriptions used to generate the images in their articles. Despite challenges in the scoring and testing process, GPT-4 consistently outperformed the other models, demonstrating exceptional versatility and capability. It emerged as the most reliable model for producing high-quality, insightful articles on cultural holidays.

## Vesak

Following the release of GPT-4, I compared its output to that of its predecessors, ChatGPT-4 and GPT-3.5, to evaluate how well it measured up against the others.

This is a set of criteria for rating the quality of the writing and tone for holiday-specific articles. I have several sets of articles that I need you to rate for me using this process:
1. Analyze each of the articles thoroughly.
2. You will calibrate the spectrum of the scale for each individual item within the provided criteria. For each individual criterion, you MUST establish the article that is the worst of the set as a score of 1; conversely, you MUST establish the article that is the best of the set as 5.
3. Using the spectrum for each individual item within the criteria, you will determine the score of the remaining articles for each individual item.
4. Once you have completed the prior steps, you will provide the results for each article as a bulleted list using the criteria items as the index, with each score provided by article name.
8. Afterwards, you will provide the total scores for each item using the name of the article to identify each of them.

Are you ready for the articles?
```

I don‚Äôt recall GPT indicating it would "take some time" before, which means it would require another prompt to get the results. I‚Äôve had Claude do this occasionally, but it seems the expectation that results be provided ‚Äúnow‚Äù is gradually becoming the norm.

Total Scores

**"Vesak: A Global Celebration"**: (5*11)/11 = 5.00

**"Vesak: Enlightenment and Compassion"**: (4*8 + 3*2 + 2*1)/11 = 3.55

**"Vesak: Illuminating Buddha's Legacy"**: (3*7 + 2*4)/11 = 2.64

Despite the instructions that an article should score a 1 and another should score a 5 for calibration, this was not the outcome. However, the majority of the individual criteria resulted in scores between 5 and 3, with a few dipping down to 2, across each model. There were no items rated as a 1. Given the reliability of the AI utilized to succeed at this task, I fear I may have to ask it to perform the calibration step by step. With Anthropic seeming tightening free usage, my ability to continue with Claude will come to a halt. If I'm going to take on the cost of another subscription, it will be Perplexity, given I have real-world scenarios I'm utilizing it for. I really like Claude, but I have no assurance that it is strong enough in a general sense to replace GPT.

As expected, GPT-4 scored better than GPT-4o, and we all knew GPT-3.5 was doomed, so no surprises there. Ignoring the jump in scores (expected results of the instructions regarding calibration on such a limited set), I end up with many questions as a result. Were the scores a result of the model? Was it the subject matter, the requested tone, etc.? It will be interesting to see if this result persists at all, regardless of whether I uncover the reasons behind it.

## Kyiv Day

For Kyiv Day, I swapped out ChatGPT-3.5 for Claude 3 Sonnet and performed the same experiment. I provided Claude with the XML version of the role and instructions.

- **"Kyiv Day: Celebrating History and Unity"**: 5 - Exceptionally positive, uplifting, and celebratory, perfectly capturing the holiday spirit.

- **"Celebrating Kyiv: City of History and Vibrancy"**: 4 - Strongly positive; effectively highlights joy and celebration.
- **"Kyiv Day: Celebrating Ukraine's Resilient Capital"**: 3 - Maintains a positive tone while acknowledging but not dwelling on negatives.

### Total Scores

- **"Kyiv Day: Celebrating History and Unity"**: (5*11)/11 = 5.00
- **"Celebrating Kyiv: City of History and Vibrancy"**: (4*8 + 3*2 + 2*1)/11 = 3.55
- **"Kyiv Day: Celebrating Ukraine's Resilient Capital"**: (3*7 + 2*4)/11 = 2.64

These scores represent a comparative evaluation of the articles based on the defined criteria, highlighting the relative strengths and weaknesses of each piece in the context of cultural reporting on Kyiv Day.

Again, GPT-4 outscored GPT-4o. Having altered the role and template, the article from Claude resulted in the word counts being around 30% of what was specified. An issue I had overcome before. Upon challenging the count, I got an adequate article, but when I attempted to get the scores for the article from Claude, it failed to provide a spread of scores greater than 1.5 points. Clearly, something has gone south with the new instructions and Claude. Now that I'm five months in, I question the necessary effort to correct the issue for this experiment when the number of prompts with Claude has become a challenging limitation. I'm sorry Claude, I may have to leave you.

## Children's Day

Reading over the latest prompts, I found that when asked to convert the GPT instructions to XML, Claude wrote one of the sections as part of the instructions without adhering to them. I have to conclude that the shortage of text in the last article and the resulting scores were due to the presence of this section. Alternatively, I might have pasted it in by accident and have no explanation for what occurred.

Regardless, I made a few tweaks to the instructions to make them more prescriptive, which yielded the desired output.

```
You will provide an article on Children's Day in Nigeria. You will use the provided template, follow the instructions, and use the prescribed process. Write with a tone that is both professional and educational. Begin with the first step.
```

To get started, I had Claude 3, ChatGPT-4, and ChatGPT-4o write articles and included a tone to have each write an article. Afterwards, I had each of the three review and score the three articles.

**Claude**

- Nigeria C3.docx: 4.82
- Nigeria 4GPT.docx: 3.73
- Nigeria GPT4o.docx: 2.73

**GPT-4**

- **"Celebrating Nigeria‚Äôs Future: Children‚Äôs Day"**: 5.00
- **"Nigerian Children‚Äôs Day Celebration"**: 3.64
- **"A Celebration of Hope and Heritage"**: 2.73

**GPT-4o**

- **Nigeria GPT4o.docx**: 2.45
- **Nigeria GPT4.docx**: 3.91
- **Nigeria C3.docx**: 4.82

Interestingly enough, Claude and ChatGPT-4o resulted in nearly identical scores for the three articles, with Claude having written the best one and ChatGPT-4 coming in second. ChatGPT-4, however, had a slightly larger spectrum of scores but with Claude-3 coming in last.

```
Provide a brief summary that explains the scoring of the 3 articles against one another.
```

In evaluating the three articles on Nigeria's Children's Day, the scores reflect a comparative assessment based on criteria such as ethical considerations, cultural sensitivity, originality, factual correctness, and engagement, among others.

1. **"Celebrating Nigeria‚Äôs Future: Children‚Äôs Day"** received the highest score of 5.00, showcasing exemplary performance across all criteria. This article stood out for its exceptional depth of analysis, cultural sensitivity, and engaging narrative. It effectively demonstrated a comprehensive understanding of the cultural significance of Children's Day, supported by well-verified sources and original insights.
2. **"Nigerian Children's Day Celebration"** scored 3.64, performing strongly, especially in areas like cultural sensitivity and engagement. It offered thorough analysis and insights into the celebration's impact on child welfare but fell short of the top score due to slightly less originality and slightly more use of filler content compared to the highest-scoring article.
3. **"A Celebration of Hope and Heritage"** scored 2.73, showing a decent understanding and respect for the cultural context but was marked down for its lack of originality and clarity. This article provided a general overview with some insightful moments but struggled with coherence and depth compared to the other two articles.

Overall, the scoring reflects how each article addressed the importance of Children's Day in Nigeria, with varying degrees of analytical depth, cultural engagement, and narrative clarity. The highest-scoring article excelled by providing a rich, detailed account that was both informative and compelling, setting a high benchmark for cultural reporting.

Thinking back to the tones the AI identified as their defaults, Claude leaned towards an educational tone. My hypothesis is that the educational tone in the author's instructions and resulting article impacted the scoring. If so, the two versions of GPT are interpreting the tone differently, or this was an anomaly.

## Memorial Day

Following up on the results for Children's Day in Nigeria, I used the same prompts and process; however, I produced four articles per model, using the same session as before to write them rather than fresh ones. I didn't define a tone for the initial writing, assuming it would continue with the combination of professional and educational tones. Afterwards, I followed up with professional, educational, and then no tone.

### Claude

c3-edu.docx: 4.73

c3-first.docx: 4.27

c3-pro.docx: 4.55

cr-none.docx: 3.64

gpt4-none.docx: 3.82

gpt4-pro.docx: 4.64

gpt4-edu.docx: 4.55

gpt4-first.docx: 4.27

gpt4o-first.docx: 4.36

gpt4o-none.docx: 3.09

gpt4o-edu.docx: 3.09

gpt4o-pro.docx: 4.64

### ChatGPT-4

**Total Scores Calculation:**

- **‚Äúgpt4-pro.docx‚Äù:** Sum and average of the scores across criteria.
- **‚Äúc3-pro.docx‚Äù:** Sum and average of the scores across criteria.
- **‚Äúgpt4o-pro.docx‚Äù:** Sum and average of the scores across criteria.

I will now perform these recalculations and provide the recalibrated total scores for each article.

```
And?
```

Here are the recalibrated total scores for the three articles:

1. **"gpt4-pro.docx"**: 2.91

2. **"c3-pro.docx"**: 3.09

3. **"gpt4o-pro.docx"**: 2.82

These scores reflect the recalibration process, where each article was ranked against each other across various criteria, ensuring differentiation in their evaluation based on their relative strengths and weaknesses in each category.

### ChatGPT-4o

**Total Scores**

- **c3-pro.docx **(4+4+4+3+4+4+4+4+4+4+4) / 11 = 3.82
- **gpt4-pro.docx **(5+5+5+5+5+5+5+5+5+5+5) / 11 = 5.00
- **gpt4o-pro.docx **(3+3+3+4+3+3+3+3+3+3+3) / 11 = 3.18

**Summary**

**c3-pro.docx**: 3.82

**gpt4-pro.docx**: 5.00

**gpt4o-pro.docx**: 3.18

The scores reflect a comprehensive analysis of each article based on the provided criteria, with ‚Äúgpt4-pro.docx‚Äù scoring the highest for its professional tone, accuracy, and engaging content.

While the spread of scores was wide enough to identify the articles perceived by the AI to be the best, it's clear the calibration is continuing to fall short of expectations despite the occasional glimmer of success. I may have to consider including examples with the criteria once again; however, this only adds to the challenges I'm seeing with Claude.

The length limit in the free tier of Claude 3 is increasingly challenging to work with. As the articles have grown longer, now closer to the word count for the most part, trying to rate several articles in one session is becoming difficult, and doing it across sessions undermines any real consistency. I may have to rely on GPT to score larger sets.

## Less is More

Overall, the comparative experiment reveals ChatGPT-4 as the most reliable model for producing high-quality articles on cultural holidays. ChatGPT-4o appeared to be just as useful, and faster, for tasks with low to no creative expectations. While challenges in calibration and prompt management persist, the insights gained from this experiment highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each model.

## Key Insights

**Positive Observations:**

- GPT-4 consistently scored higher than GPT-4o and Claude in various cultural articles, showcasing its strength in handling diverse topics and tones effectively.
- The structured and detailed instructions helped maintain consistency in the articles produced by different models, ensuring a fair comparison.

**Encountered Challenges:**

- Calibration of the scoring process remains inconsistent, with difficulty in establishing a clear spectrum for each criterion across different articles.
- Limitations in prompt length with Claude hindered the ability to fully explore and assess the articles in one session.
- The need to prompt models multiple times for clarity and detailed output increased the complexity of managing and comparing the results.
