<u></u>Artwork created with Midjourney v5.2### Preface

This post is part of a year-long <u>initiative where I employ AI to create content</u> about holiday traditions worldwide. The objective is to observe how various AI tools perform and improve in content creation with minimal human intervention over time. This article is 5 of 8 posts for the month of <u>February</u>.

*Prompts and interactions with different AI models will be documented as they occur, providing insights into the methodologies, challenges, and adjustments made throughout the project.*

Recognizing the challenges of maintaining prompt quality and the problems arising from model differences, I find the task of producing comprehensive articles for a 15-day holiday increasingly daunting. Going forward, I plan to be more concise and focus on the essence of the experimentation. Following a productive session with Claude on day two, I will conduct two additional rounds before exploring new avenues and aim to streamline each session to spare readers extensive reading, all Ron of them.

### **Day 3**

Both Claude and ChatGPT delivered commendable initial drafts of their articles. I then had the historian roles review each other's work, which yielded predominantly positive feedback.

On an additional note, while neither AI met the criteria for image descriptions perfectly, they both managed to produce satisfactory results with minimal intervention on my part.

```
I have an alternative article from another author. Please review it closely for any issues such as grammar, spelling, punctuation, accuracy, etc.
```

#### GPT on Claude

The article draft on the third day of the Spring Festival, focusing on offerings to Chigou, is rich in cultural detail and historical context. To refine it:

**Title and Subtitle**: These are engaging and set a thematic tone that intrigues the reader about Chigou's significance.

**Introduction**: It sets a vivid scene but could briefly ***contextualize Chigou within the Spring***** **Festival** *****wider celebrations*** for clarity.

**Historical Background**: The transformation of Chigou from a mortal dog to a deity is compelling. ***Incorporating a bit more about the deity's role in the pantheon*** and its reflection on human-nature-divine relationships could enrich this section.

**Imagery Descriptions**: The imagery brings the narrative to life. Slight adjustments to ***ensure respectful and factual representations*** would maintain the article's tone, ***focusing on the deity's revered status rather than a menacing presence***.

**Persisting Rural Traditions**: This beautifully illustrates the tradition's continuity. Adding contemporary practices or urban observances could provide a comprehensive view of Chigou's observance today.

**Conclusion**: Tying back the specific observances of Chigou to the broader themes of renewal and prosperity in the Spring Festival would round off the article well.

Overall, the draft provides a detailed exploration of Chigou's significance. With slight adjustments for broader context and balance, it could offer a holistic view of this unique observance within the Spring Festival.

#### Claude on GPT

Based on my review, here are some suggested revisions to further strengthen the article:

**Introduction**

Well-crafted hook drawing readers in with an air of mystery and intrigue surrounding the day's unique essence.

***Tighten up the content paragraph to be more concise*** (around 100 words).

Photo description nicely sets the tone.

**Historical and Cultural Background**

Excellent elaboration on the origins and significance of rituals/traditions.

Photo descriptions effectively complement the text with visual glimpses into the past.

**Today's Practices and Traditions**

Consider **weaving in examples of specific paper offerings** being burned today (electronics, cars etc).

For visual variety, the first photo description could focus closer on the miniature details of offerings being burnt while the second photo depicts the quiet street scene.

**Conclusion**

Beautiful summation calling readers to reflection/action.

Final photo ties together the themes of passing from solemnity into celebration nicely.

**Overall**

Well-structured article with skillful blending of history/culture into modern practice.

Engaging and educational for readers seeking to appreciate this unique day honoring both caution and tradition amidst the Spring Festival. Let me know if any aspect needs more clarification or expansion! Great job capturing the essence of the 3rd day.

Claude's demeanor often seems geared towards friendliness, which I suspect might lead to a somewhat lenient approach in critiques. Finding a balance is challenging; I'm wary of swinging too far towards harshness. The established criteria should provide some equilibrium, yet I anticipate Claude may still err on the side of gentleness. It's an area for observation, and should the need arise for a more critical edge, I'm open to suggestions on how to achieve this without creating undue barriers for Claude.

### **Day 4**

On the fourth day, I encountered content that seemed to pertain to different holidays, prompting me to conduct further research. This revealed a greater diversity in the festival days than I had initially realized, underscoring the importance of educating myself about these holidays to anticipate such surprises in the future.

I've started referencing a <u>Changzhou website</u> to provide a bit of context to each AI in order to guide them on what aspect of the day they may draw upon.

```
Write the article for Day 4. The information available to me is as follows: The old saying "three rams bring bliss" is connected with the fourth day, which says that by making a good beginning a happy end comes. According to folklore, it is also the day to welcome back the Kitchen God. On this day, the Kitchen God would check the household and therefore people should not leave home.
```

This exercise aimed to generate articles on a consistent theme, yet Claude began to deviate from the provided template, leading to an omitted section and misplaced photo descriptions. I'm inclined to think this might become a recurring issue. My efforts to fine-tune the tones have been impeded; therefore, I will integrate the visual communications role to streamline the image creation process.

```
The article for Day 4 does not adhere to the provided template. Please rewrite it without image descriptions. After you have provided it, and I've confirmed it is complete, I want the image descriptions provided without the article content, just the titles.After two attempts and re-introducing the template, I still encountered resistance in assembling a coherent article, though it was less problematic than the previous instance. When I requested complete image descriptions, I received several that referenced the Kitchen God's noble rooster, a detail for which I could find no historical basis. Nevertheless, the final image appealed to me, so I retained it, choosing to envision it as the Kitchen God's last supper.
```

Despite a generally positive history with Claude, I'm beginning to consider a hiatus in its use until I can refine my prompts. My previous searches for documentation on the web interface yielded little, and the API documentation I reviewed was only marginally helpful. A more thorough investigation may be in order, or perhaps an exploration into whether XML could be the solution.

In light of the challenges faced, I opted to proceed with the updated editor role as intended, but not through Claude. The issues have exhausted the free quota, and with the festival's timeline pressing, I must continue to ensure the AI articles are ready for release each morning. This step was taken in a separate session.

Subsequently, I introduced a new, more specialized editor role to the process.

```
Assume the role of an Expert Editor with a Specialization in Historical Content with the following skills and traits:
-   Proficient in identifying and correcting grammar and spelling errors with an exceptional eye for detail
-   Experienced in using rating systems to evaluate various qualities of an article, including coherence, accuracy, and engagement

-   Knowledge of primary and secondary historical sources for verifying facts and interpretations
-   Adaptability to different historical genres and periods, with a broad understanding of global history
-   Attention to detail in fact-checking and referencing, ensuring all content is well-supported and credible
-   Researching skills to identify authoritative sources and additional literature to validate article content
-   Continuous learning to stay updated with the latest research and developments in the field of history
-   Concise communication to provide clear and actionable feedback to writers on improving their work

### Day 5

As I've mentioned before, I am not a professional researcher; my work here is about experimentation, not formal research. This next step might be seen as more than a minor oversight.

I'm initiating a new thread with each AI, providing context on our progress and outlining the next steps. ChatGPT-4 will follow the same instructions and template as before. Claude, however, will receive the same instructions with one significant alteration: all references to image descriptions will be removed from the template. It may seem like an uneven playing field, but to compensate, I'm introducing a role that specializes in imagery, relieving Claude of that responsibility entirely. It's a bold move, but it's all part of the process of pushing boundaries and exploring possibilities.

#### ChatGPT

"Welcoming the God of Fortune" (Article 1)

"Day 5: Welcoming the God of Wealth" (Article 2)

**Accuracy and Factual Correctness: 4 vs 4** Justification for Difference: Both articles were accurate in presenting the traditions and cultural backgrounds of their respective subjects. No significant difference in the accuracy and factual correctness between the two articles.

**Depth of Historical Context: 4 vs 5** Justification for Difference: Article 2 provided a more comprehensive historical overview, detailing the origins and significance of the God of Wealth with greater depth compared to Article 1's exploration of Cai Shen and "Po Wu" traditions.

**Ratio of Informational Content vs Filler Words: 4 vs 5** Justification for Difference: Article 2 was denser with information, offering a richer narrative without unnecessary elaboration, compared to Article 1, which balanced informative content with engaging narrative but contained slightly more narrative embellishment.

**Clarity and Coherence: 4 vs 5** Justification for Difference: Article 2 was exceptionally well-structured, presenting a seamless progression from historical origins to modern practices, which was slightly more coherent than Article 1's structure.

**Engagement and Readability: 5 vs 4** Justification for Difference: Article 1 was highly engaging with vivid descriptions and a narrative style, while Article 2, although compelling, could have utilized more varied storytelling techniques to enhance engagement.

**Critical Analysis and Interpretation: 3 vs 4** Justification for Difference: Article 2 offered more insightful analysis regarding the cultural and economic contexts of the God of Wealth, whereas Article 1 had room for deeper exploration into the implications and variations of the traditions it discussed.

Although Article 1 was more engaging, Article 2's comprehensive approach and insightful analysis provided a slightly richer and more informative narrative.

The main takeaway here is that with image management removed, the two articles produced didn't have as much of a difference in rating, and both essentially resulted in the same delta and favored article. While there is a bit of a wildcard introduced in the fact I didn't create a new editor session for this round, I'm going to take the win as it is :)

Another thing to take into account is that Claude has consistently come in with less verbose responses both within these experiments as well as outside of them, typically erring to be straightforward once getting past its chatty bits. This result isn't entirely surprising, and I'd wager measuring the word counts would have a similar delta between the articles. I'll make a note to check this at some future point.

### Day 6

Despite my intention to press ahead, I've decided to spend another day verifying the results from the previous day.

```
Write the article for Day 6. This is the information available to me: On the sixth day, people make wishes for "ma dao cheng gong", win success immediately upon arrival.

According to tradition, families usually send away the Ghost of Poverty on this day. To send away him, Chinese people will usually throw away their ragged clothes, rubbish and other dirty things.

By doing this Chinese people wish to send away poverty and welcome the beautiful days and good luck in the New Year.
```

After receiving both articles I took them to the editors to see how our authors did.

```
Analyze both articles and provide a table that contains the scores for both articles and gives the justification for the difference between the scores. Include the names of the articles in the first row.
```

### Claude

Claude's performance in the editing role has been somewhat lacking, leading me to establish a new editor role. This role will involve reviewing two articles, each accompanied by a criteria table for evaluation. Following these individual assessments, a third table will be used for a comprehensive evaluation of both articles.

```
Let's try this again. Reevaluate the last two articles I supplied as well as the rating criteria. Provide me with a markdown table that covers each item in the criteria, as documented, and has columns for the scores of each. It should have an additional column for the justification in the difference of the scores. Do not add or remove criteria, be sure to include the full article title in the first row and the final score in the last row.
```

You're right, I should have referred back to the established rating criteria. Please find a comprehensive comparative analysis of the latest two article drafts below:

Article 1 - Day 6: Banishing Poverty and Welcoming Success vs Article 2 - Day 6: Banishing Poverty, Welcoming Fortune **Accuracy and Factual Correctness: 5 vs 5** Justification for Score Differences: Both equally align with provided background on rituals and symbolism.

This adjusted analysis underscores that both articles are equally effective in their portrayal of the Spring Festival sixth-day tradition, with each bringing valuable insights and engaging narratives to the reader without significant differences in quality or depth as initially assessed.

In the end, I had both editors review and confirm the comparison table. First, I went with GPT because it rated both articles the same, and then a second time with Claude, given the significant difference in ratings between the articles. I need to stop procrastinating and take the time to use both a generic role and a specialized role to create articles as examples. These examples will then serve as a basis for ratings to guide each of the participants.
