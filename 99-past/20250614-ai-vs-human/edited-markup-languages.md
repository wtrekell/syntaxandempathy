# Mermaid AI: A Tool Trial for Diagramming

*Testing the capabilities of AI-assisted diagram creation*

**TL;DR:** What began as a simple test of Mermaid AI for diagramming evolved into a revealing exploration of human-AI collaboration. The trial showed that **AI excels at generating initial structures 4-5x faster than manual methods**, but **struggles with modifications and maintaining stylistic consistency**. This journey from verbose complexity to streamlined visualization highlighted when AI assistance delivers genuine value versus when it creates unnecessary friction.

## Why Try Another Tool?

My first exposure to Mermaid script came through ChatGPT when I asked it to create a diagram. Since then, I've used the script version for over a year because of its flexibility and practicality.

Diagramming tools always present tradeoffs. Mermaid script enables quick modifications even if the output isn't presentation quality. Figma produces polished results but becomes impractical for early iterations requiring frequent changes.

My curiosity about Mermaid AI was straightforward: would it combine script flexibility with faster creation? I wanted to test the tool, not create a specific diagram.

## Starting Without a Clear Map

Typically, I sketch a diagram before using any tool, ensuring clear direction. This time, I jumped into testing the AI without proper planning. This lack of preparation led to a frustrating cycle of restructuring an increasingly complex diagram. The experience reinforced a critical insight—your diagramming approach must match your level of clarity about what you're visualizing.

Looking back, I see how different approaches serve different scenarios:

### For Exploration Mode (Figuring It Out As You Go)
- Start with a simple outline, then expand as you review and reconsider
- Build the diagram incrementally rather than attempting the entire structure at once
- Use Mermaid AI for generating small sections that you gradually connect

### For Direction Mode (Having a Solid Idea)
- Provide the AI with a clear framework and let it fill in details
- Plan for a manual pass through the code to clean up and standardize
- Use AI as an accelerator, not a complete solution

### For Documentation Mode (Knowing Exactly What You Need)
- Write out the diagram in text first, then use that as a script for the AI
- This approach minimizes surprises and maximizes control

I approached the tool as if I had a solid idea when I was actually still exploring. The problems intensified when making substantial changes to existing sections—precisely when a more iterative approach would have worked better.

## AI Diagramming: Strengths, Limitations, and Mental Models

### The Speed-Control Tradeoff

My testing revealed a fundamental tradeoff with AI-assisted diagramming. Where Mermaid AI truly delivered was in generating the initial structure—what would have taken an hour of manual setup materialized in minutes. The AI generated a robust first draft approximately 4-5x faster than manual methods, providing a significant time advantage and something tangible to refine.

However, this initial speed advantage quickly diminished during the revision phase. While the AI handled additive instructions well ("add this node," "connect these elements"), it became unreliable during modifications. Requesting a change to one element often resulted in the AI breaking previously established connections.

This pattern—rapid initial creation followed by diminishing returns during refinement—appears consistent across many AI tools. The technology excels at generating scaffolding but struggles with contextual understanding during iterative improvements.

### Behind the Interface: Code Quality Issues

These modification challenges eventually drove me to examine the underlying Mermaid code, revealing another limitation: the AI had stripped my template formatting and produced unnecessarily verbose syntax. For someone who values code clarity, this was problematic.

I discovered you could explicitly instruct the AI to maintain existing connections, but you need to know to do this—highlighting how effective collaboration with AI tools often requires discovering their specific behaviors through trial and error rather than intuitive interaction.

### A Mental Model for Effective Collaboration

Think of AI diagramming tools as technical collaborators rather than independent creators—assistants who can rapidly generate initial drafts but require clear direction and oversight during revisions. The familiar UX principle of progressive disclosure applies perfectly: just as interfaces should reveal complexity gradually, your approach to AI diagramming should match your level of clarity about the desired outcome.

This creates a natural mapping between your mental state (documenting vs. revising) and your diagramming approach (structured vs. iterative). Understanding this relationship creates more realistic expectations about when AI assistance delivers value versus when it creates unnecessary friction.

## Pro Tips From My Experience

Through dozens of iterations, my diagram evolved from a complex tangle to a streamlined visualization. Here are key insights for working effectively with Mermaid AI:

1. **Match approach to clarity level:** Use different strategies based on whether you're exploring, have a direction, or are documenting established concepts

2. **Use brief node names:** Short identifiers make adjustments significantly easier

3. **Create visual hierarchy:** Use subgraphs to logically group related activities

4. **Explicitly maintain connections:** Tell the AI to preserve existing relationships when making changes

5. **Leverage 'Change All' functionality:** For consistent updates across complex diagrams

6. **Document the creation process:** Especially important when others will modify the diagram later

7. **Consider collaboration implications:** Be transparent about AI assistance when sharing with teams or clients

8. **Expect code intervention:** Plan for manual refinement after AI-generated drafts

These improvements mirror what you'd want in your mental model of any complex system: concise terminology, clear categorization, focus on key relationships, and consistent patterns.

## Integration with Broader Design Systems

Diagramming tools like Mermaid become more valuable when integrated into the broader design documentation ecosystem. Mermaid's text-based approach enables version control alongside other documentation, creating a single source of truth that evolves as systems change.

This integration transforms diagrams from static artifacts into living documentation. The ability to maintain diagrams as code provides substantial long-term value that outweighs the initial learning curve, especially for complex systems requiring ongoing updates.

## The Final Verdict

Despite the learning curve and friction points, the AI-assisted approach delivered significant value. The initial time savings alone justified the experimentation—creating the diagram manually would have taken at least twice as long.

For complex diagramming tasks, Mermaid AI offers a powerful starting point, not a complete solution. The human-AI collaboration works best when leveraging AI for rapid structure generation while maintaining control over refinement and style.

The key is knowing yourself as well as your tools. Be honest about your level of clarity, choose your approach accordingly, and remember that the process of creating the diagram might be just as valuable as the diagram itself.
